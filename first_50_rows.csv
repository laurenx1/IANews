mr. bright: thank you, madam speaker. i have an amendment at the desk. the chair: clerk will designate the amendment. the clerk: amendment number 3 printed in house report 111-133 offered by mr. bright of alabama. the speaker pro tempore:pursuant to house resolution 501, the gentleman from alabama, mr. bright, and a member opposed will each control five minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from alabama. mr. bright: madam chair, i yield myself such time as i consume. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. bright: i rise today in support of my amendment to the federal employees pay parental leave act. put simply, this amendment would ensure that federal employees called to active duty and the national guard or reserves are not penalized for their service. it would clarify the intent of   the bill so that these individuals can count the time they serve in active duty towards the time they are employed so they may remain eligible for the benefits under this bill. too often we have seen our service men and women across all branches denied the benefits they rightly deserve due to governmental red tape. there is absolutely no reason that national guard or reservists should be denied any of the benefits they deserve after honorably serving their country.again, this amendment will allow members of the guard and reserve to be able to count the time they were deployed towards their total time of employment. if passed, this amendment will give the men and women who have served our country needed time with their newborns and tend to their family responsibilities after a birth. this time is even more important when you consider that these warriors have always spent months on end away from their families. madam chair, this amendment is   simple and straight forward, it clarifies the intent of the bill for our guardsmen and our guardswomen and our reservists and err sures they won't be penalizeded for -- ensures they won't be penalized for their service to our country. i urge this and reserve the balance of my time. the chair: for what purpose does the gentleman from california rise? mr. issa: also we -- although we do not object to this we would claim the time in opposition. briefly, this amendment seems to be a good one that would try toclarify some of the many, many, many, many elements of this bill that were not worked through thoroughly in committee. so i applaud the gentleman, i believe that in fact if we would have done more of this in committee, if more people would have looked and said, we want as the committee that is charged by the congress to fight waste, fraud and abuse, that in fact if we had tightened up this bill much better earlier, we would have been more accountability to the taxpayers. so i applaud -- accountable to   the taxpayers. i applaud the gentleman, vote that it be voted positively and yield back. the chair: the gentleman yields back the balance of his time. the gentleman from alabama. mr. bright: i yield one minute of my time to mr. lynch. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. lynch: i thank the gentleman for yield and thank the gentleman from alabama for his thoughtful amendment. this amendment makes certain that federal employees who are members of the national guard or reserve will remain eligible for this benefit and be able to care for their newborn children in the same manner as all other employees.i thank the gentleman for his astute objections and his -- observations and his clarification and i urge members to support this amendment and i yield back the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman from alabama. mr. bright: madam chair in closing i'd like to thank congress lady maloney from new york, thank you very much for your hard work on this, and also chairman towns and his staff on the oversight and government reform committee for their attention to this issue and for working with my staff to draft this amendment. i would like to also thank the chairwoman slaughter in the   rules committee for ruling in favor of the amendment and allowing me to offer it on the floor today. finally i want to thank my colleagues for their continued support and commitment on this issue and again i urge all my colleagues to support this amendment and i yield back the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman yields back. the question now occurs on the amendment offered by the gentleman from alabama. those in favor say aye. those opposed, no. in the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it.","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN : June 4, 2009 7:00pm-7:30pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

applicants when they represent no threat to port commerce or national security. the price of the d.h.s. twic port credential, five-year card is $132.50. and if you're in florida you have to pay an additional $100 to $130 for the florida clearance for the same five-year period. this additional financial and bureaucratic burden on florida port businesses and workers is   unnecessary. the amendment i'm offering will restore reasonable, rational and cost-effective maritime business environment. duplicative and unnecessary costs erode the efforts to stimulate and grow florida's economy and decrease the effectiveness of national standards put in place by congress through the twic program. . if florida can justify background checks with legitimate homeland security concerns, this amendment gives them the opportunity to do so and the parallel program couldbe maintained. but if the duplicative and expensive background checks required by florida are not making our ports safer, workers should not have to pay for them. mr. chairman, i urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment. i reserve the balance of my time. the chair: the gentlewoman from florida reserves the balance of her time. for what purpose does the gentleman from pennsylvania rise? mr. dent: i rise to claim time in opposition to the amendment. the chair: without objection, the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for five minutes. mr. dent: thank you, mr. chairman.   while the transportation worker identification credential, twic card, was intended to be the one security credential required of port workers nationwide, some state governments could not wait for the federal government to establish its program. and they moved forward with their own. currently as has been stated florida is one state requiring a separate and some argue duplicative security background check card for workers in port facilities. while it's unfortunate florida port employees are required to pay for background checks twice,t.s.a. cannot share the results of its background checks with florida. florida state law allows for individuals to be disqualified even if they were qualified by the t.s.a. through differences in disqualifying crimes. perhaps a better amendment would have been to allow t.s.a. to share the results of its twic background checks with florida. i would suggest that is a better amendment than the one currently before us. as written, this amendment would   preempt florida from continuing their security background check program, a program that the florida state legislature strongly supports. additionally, some workers in port facilities receive criminal background checks, drug and alcohol testing, and credit checks as part of their screening process. many have distinguished this from the security focus screening of the twic program. it is unclear if d.h.s. would see the waterfront commissions background check as being preempted under this amendmentbecause it is an employment safety criminal background check not a security background check. while the amendment does allow a state to demonstrate a compelling homeland security reason that a separate background check is warranted, this places an extraordinary burden on a state legislature. state legislature should have the right to determine what offenses qualify as disqualifying offenses in their ports, and this amendment would preempt that. at this time i would yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from florida, mr. mica. mr. mica: if i would --   the chair: the gentleman from florida is recognized. mr. mica: if i would i'd like to be able to close. i think our side has the right in opposition. the chair: the gentleman from pennsylvania has the right to close. the gentleman is correct. the gentleman from pennsylvania reserves the balance of his time. mr. dent: i reserve. the chair: the gentlewoman from florida. ms. castor: i'd like to thank the chair of the committee, mr. thompson, from mississippi forhis leadership on this issue and the professional homeland security staff who are the committee's supportive of the of amendment. i'd also ask unanimous consent to submit for the record letters of support from the transportation trades department, the florida ports council, port everglades, port manatee, port of miami, the tampa port authority and the passenger vessel association. the chair: the gentlewoman's request will be covered by general leave. miscastor: i urge my colleagues   to support the amendment and come down on the side of economic growth in a time of economic disaster. to come down on the side of the hardworking folks at our ports to say that it's not fair in america that just because you live in one state that you're going to be subjected to additional bureaucratic barriers to get to your job. i urge approval of the amendment and yield back the balance of my time. the chair: the gentlewoman from florida yields back the balance of her time. the gentleman from pennsylvania. mr. dent: at this time, mr.chairman, i'd like to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from florida, mr. mica. the chair: the gentleman from florida is recognized for three minutes. mr. mica: do i rise in opposition to the amendment -- i do rise in opposition to the amendment the way it is crafted. i think the gentlelady from florida has very good intentions. let's look at the results here. first of all, this isn't going to eliminate the duplication that was referred to. florida can still issue an identity card, it's own identity card. it would be better to have one,   just one identity card. but they still can issue one identity card. what this amendment does is it says that the state is prohibited from conducting a separate background check. so what this comes is a protection and cover for basically thugs and criminals who are at our ports. can you not do a criminal background check. this actually prohibits that. that's why i'm opposed to it.the reason we are concerned in florida about having criminal background checks, this is the camber report, this was conducted in 2000. one of our ports had over 60% of those working at the port with criminal backgrounds. here's part of the security assessment -- i'll name this court, jacksonville, it says, it has a large physical layout of its facilities. three noncontiguous term nams.   the port represents a lucrative target to would-be smugglers and terrorists. this amendment by the way it is crafted, it should be revised, would prohibit florida from even if they want to, and still can with this amendment, they can issue their own card. but they can't conduct a criminal background check. that's wrong. that's wrong. we can't provide cover for thugs and criminals. and you hear from this reportthat it does pose both a criminal and terrorist threat. that needs to be addressed. this amendment the way it's crafted does not do that. the chair: the gentleman yields back the balance of his time. the gentleman from pennsylvania yields back the balance of his time. mr. dent: i yield back. the chair: the question is on the amendment offered by the the gentlelady from florida. so many as are in favor say aye. those opposed, no. in the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. the amendment is adopted.   it is now in order to consider amendment number 8 pritchtprinted in house report number 111-127. for what purpose does the gentleman from arizona rise? mr. flake: i have an amendment at the desk. the chair: the clerk will designate the amendment. the clerk: amendment number 8 printed in house report number 111-127, offered by mr. flake of arizona. the chair: pursuant to house resolution 474, the gentleman from arizona, mr. flake, and a member opposed, each will control five minutes.the chair recognizes the gentleman from arizona. mr. flake: i thank the speaker. let me say from the outset this is i believe a bipartisan amendment. similar amendment has been adopted in previous authorizations. so i'm pleased to offer it. h.r. 2200 as we know establishes a new grant program that would provide grants to operators of general aviation airports for projects to enhance perimeter security, airfield security, and terminal security.   noticeably absent from the language however is the determination on how this grant money is to be spent. too often we have seen legitimate grant programs become vehicles for member projects. members will simply earmark these funds for projects back home. a great example of this is fema's predisaster mitigation grant program. originally this program was intended to save lives and reduce property damage by producing -- providing funds, quote, for hazard mitigationplanning, acquisition, relocation of structures, out of the flood plain, end quote. rather than continuing to award grants that have, as they have traditionally been awarded on the basis of merit, using a 70-page guidance document that details requirements and criteria, congress decided in 2007 to earmark about half of that funding. that same grant program was earmarked in last year's homeland security appropriations bill, and i have little doubt   that it will be earmarked again this year as well. because once earmarks start to flow, you can rarely cut them off. so you have legitimate grant programs with a legitimate purpose. you have applicants waiting to apply only to find that the money in the account has been drained by member earmarks. the objectives -- let me just say another example of this is the cops grants program. it was cited to cost $5.5billion over the past five years. these are some of the most heavily earmarked programs that the congress authorizes. specifically the cops law enforcement and technology grant program appropriated about 187 -- $187 million in fiscal year 2009. that accounted for more than 500 earmarks, including -- included in both the house and senate at the cost of more than $185 million. this means that nearly 100% of the funds for that particular   cops program were earmarked for particular towns and cities. i mention this because that's an example of other areas where in some cases like the homeland security program, we said many times we will not earmark these dollars. and yet unless we have a specific prohibition or language prohibiting it, it happens. and so these accounts go wanting later. i'm offering this amendment obviously to prevent wasteful use of taxpayer dollars. if we are going to authorizegrant programs to meet specific needs, we need to ensure that these are met in a straightforward manner. this amendment is simple. it would establish the presumption that the general aviation security grants will be awarded using competitive means and based on risk. should the t.s.a. decide to use an alternative means of awarding these grants, the amendment requires that the t.s.a. provide to congress a report explaining that decision. lastly the amendment would prohibit this grant program from   ever being earmarked. if congress is serious about enhancing security at general aviation airports including this kind of instructive language is necessary. history shows that without it these programs -- these accounts will become earmarked and it will nullify any legitimate need for the program to begin with. i urge support for this bipartisan amendment. and reserve my time. the chair: the gentleman from arizona reserves the balance of his time. for what purpose does the gentleman from mississippi rise? mr. thompson: mr. chairman,while not opposed to the amendment i ask unanimous consent to claim time in opposition. the chair: without objection. the gentleman from mississippi is recognized for five minutes. mr. thompson: thank you. mr. chair, i'm pleased to support this amendment. which reaffirms that grant awarded to general aviation airports under this bill are done so through a competitive process. mr. flake's amendment based on the competition and risk is the right thing to do. i support the amendment and yield back the balance of my time.   the chair: the gentleman yields back the balance of his time. the gentleman from arizona. mr. flake: i thank the gentleman. i also want to thank the chairman for working with my staff to insert language to make sure that these programs, the wording of these programs would be based on risk. that was a great addition to this amendment that i appreciate being able to work with the chairman of the committee on this. i yield back the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman yields back the balance of his time. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona. so many as are in favor say aye. those opposed, no.in the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. the amendment is agreed to. it is now in order to consider amendment number 9 printed in house report number 111-127. for what purpose does the gentleman from massachusetts rise? mr. lynch: good afternoon, mr. chairman. i believe i have an amendment at the desk. the chair: the clerk will designate the amendment. the clerk: amendment number 9, printed in house report number 111-127, offered by mr. lynch of massachusetts. the chair: pursuant to house resolution 474, the gentleman from massachusetts, mr. lynch, and a member opposed, each will   control five minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from massachusetts. mr. lynch: thank you, mr. chairman. i want to thank mr. thompson, the chair of the homeland security committee, for his great work on this bill. specifically this amendment that i have offered would address a difficult situation that is faced by our transit security officers, especially those on the mexican border, but in every port of entry in the united states. we have about 50,000 of these officers that actually come incontact, physically wanding and screening travelers. as you may remember after the outbreak of h 1. n 1 virus -- h1n1 i virus the outbreak was in mexico city. the officers we put on the border, especially in laredo, texas, and other heavily affected states, were not allowed, they were not allowed to wear asks, to wear gloves, or   to use hand sanitizer as they proceeded to screen travelers coming through from mexico. a bizarre situation develed where our officers actually were able to look across at the mexican security officers who all had masks on, they all had gloves on, yet our own t.s.a. did not allow our workers to wear masks or gloves. in fact when our officers took the initiatives to protect themselves, they were told by their superiors to take offthose gloves, take office those masks. you're alarming the traveling public. many of these officers actually screen up to 3,000 visitors, travelers per shift. so they were actually exposed to a high degree to people who were exhibiting influenza. there are a couple of stark instances we received on the committee, affidavits from officers who actually confronted travelers who were visibly sick   and yet they were told even in those instances they were not allowed to wear gloves and masks. . what this amendment would do would be to direct the homeland -- excuse me -- the transportation security administration to basically issue guidance that would allow these workers to protect themselves. at this point i'd like to yield to the ranking member on oursubcommittee on the federal work force, mr. chaffetz -- i'm sorry, i'll yield back my time at this moment -- no, i'll reserve my time. the chair: the gentleman from massachusetts reserves the balance of his time. for what purpose does the gentleman rise? mr. chaffetz: i rise to claim time in opposition to the amendment although i am not opposed. the chair: without objection, the gentleman is recognized for five minutes. mr. chaffetz: thank you, mr. chairman. i thank chairman lynch for his great work in identifying this   as a challenge. we have so many great men and women who serve at the t.s.a. in the front lines that are dealing with literally 10's of thousands of people at a time some which would be sick. we put first and foremost the protection and safety of the t.s.a. employees so if they choose to dawn a mask or put on gloves to protect their loved ones, their livelihood, that we should afford them that opportunity. we saw in the committee hearing that there is a great deal of confusion with the t.s.a. this amendment, which i appreciate mr. lynch bringingforward, helps clarify that so there's no ambiguity, so we can make sure that the t.s.a. employees has the safety and security that they deserve. and with that, mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman from utah reserves the balance of his time. the gentleman from massachusetts. mr. lynch: thank you, mr. chairman. mr. chairman, i just want to point out the odd situation we have here. we have the world health organization that actually brought us up to a level five, they're now considering going to a level six on this   influenza. and yet you had transportation and security and d.h.s. saying they did not think it was not medically necessary for our folks to wear these. you had the centers for disease control here in the united states in atlanta alerting americans just, you know, generally to, you know, cover your mouth, avoid unnecessary travel to mexico, take prudent steps to protect yourself. and yet we had these officerson the border that are screening in 3,000 people per day and they weren't allowing those individuals to wear masks. i think it's -- it points out a terrible incongruity in our policy. we have been trying to get them to change that policy. they would not do it voluntarily. we are put in a position to do this legislatively. mr. chairman, can i ask how much time i have remaining? the chair: the gentleman from massachusetts has 1 1/2 minutes remaining.   the gentleman from utah has four minutes remaining. mr. lynch: i'll reserve my time at this point. the chair: the gentleman from massachusetts reserves the balance of his time. the gentleman from utah. mr. chaffetz: mr. chairman, i'd like to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from california, mr. bilbray. the chair: the gentleman from california is recognized. mr. bilbray: i stand in support of the gentleman's amendment. i think it's a commonsense amendment on government oversight. with you saw how there was an inconsistency with the stated purpose of protecting not only the public in general but alsoour employees. but we also saw there was a degree of let's just say insensitivity to the fact of allowing individuals the decency -- allowing them to protect their own health. let me address the author. this addresses a problem we didn't address in our committee and that is the public relations concern that sort of, you know, trumped good common sense and public health. and i think that if we make   this clear with your amendment now you've got a supervisor who now may be concerned about if somebody wears a mask i might get a complaint and i don't want to put up with that kind of heat. now can say with your amendment that if i get a complaint i have the ability to point to a congressional directive here and i have a reason why i can protect myself by allowing the employee to make this call themselves on their own public health. i think this not only work forthe employee on the front line -- it serves not only the public health of the employee but it also serves the administrative structure because it eliminates, basically reduces the degree of threat they have of being attacked for allowing the employee to have that. and i think the heat should stop here. i think the buck stops here. i think we set the example, and i appreciate the gentleman proposing this amendment. and i like to point out, this is the kind of bipartisan cooperation we have in   government oversight, and i'm very proud of it. i'm very proud to support your amendment, mr. chairman, and i yield back. the chair: the gentleman from california yields back the balance of his time. the gentleman from utah. mr. chaffetz: thank you, mr. chairman. i urge passage and i i yield to yeel. the chair: the gentleman from utah yields back the balance of his time. the gentleman from massachusetts. mr. lynch: thank you, mr. chairman. i want to point out something that mr. bilbray, the gentlemanfrom california raised. there have been on several occasions justification for people not allowing to wear masks, the justification seems to be that they -- the airlines and transportation officials don't want to alarm the public. i just want to point out when you travel around the globe, wearing these small dust masks, these are not large evil looking devices. these are simple dust masks that can be used. they look fairly common. you see them a lot overseas.   it's quite a common thing, and as they become more widely used, i think it will become commonplace and will not bring alarm. the last point i want to make is this. these employees don't have the right to collectively bargain. they don't have a representative to file a grievance when they are told to take off their masks or gloves or their refuse -- refusal to use purell or something likethat. they wouldn't have to come to me. i feel like i'm the business manager for the transportation employees. and while i'm honored to have that responsibility i think it would be much better handled if they had the right to collectively bargain and they have their own employee representatives intervene on their behalf when their own personal safety and the safety of their families is threatened. with that, mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman's time has expired.   the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts. all those in favor say aye. those opposed, no. in the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. the amendment is agreed to. it is now in order to consider amendment number 10 printed in house report 111-127. for what purpose does the gentleman from utah rise? mr. chaffetz: mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair: the clerk will designate the amendment. the clerk: amendment number 10 printed in house report 111-127 offered by mr. chaffetz of utah. the chair: pursuant to house resolution 474, the gentlemanfrom utah, mr. chaffetz, and a member opposed, each will control five minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from utah. mr. chaffetz: thank you, mr. chairman. at this time i'd like to recognize the gentlewoman from new hampshire, ms. shea-porter. for two minutes. the chair: the gentlewoman from new hampshire is recognized for two minutes. ms. shea-porter: thank you, mr. chair. i'd like to thank chairman thompson and his staff for their hard work on this very important bill. i'd also like to thank my colleague, mr. chaffetz. we share a deep concern and   respect for the privacy of individuals. when this full body imaging was first introduced, t.s.a. said it would only be used as a secondary screening method for those people who set off a metal detector. now it has become very clear that the t.s.a. intends for this technology to replace metal detectors at airports all over the country. ""the new york times"" reported as much in an april 7, 2009 article. the chaffetz-shea-porter amendment would ensure that full body imaging would be a secondary device. and people that go through itis well informed. mr. chairman, we do not take this lightly. as a member of the armed services committee, i'm very aware of the security threats that are facing our country. we too want to ensure that the department of homeland security and the t.s.a. have the tools that they need to prevent future terrorist attacks. however, the steps that we take to ensure our safety should not be so intrusive that they infringe on the very freedom that we aim to protect. two weeks ago i went to washington national airport to   view one of these machines. i saw how the technologies being used, the techniques being used and the procedures that t.s.a. is being put into place to protect our privacy. the images is very revealing. it's ill -- illlogical because if we allow this then -- illogical because if we allow it should be at every single building that we enter andevery single bus we enter. i ask my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment. thank you. i yield back. the chair: the gentleman from utah reserves. for what purpose does the gentleman rise? >> i rise to claim the time, reluctantly, in opposition to the amendment. the chair: the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for five minutes. mr. dent: i took a good look at the whole body imaging machines over at reagan international airport.   i have to say a couple of things about this. i was impressed by the technology. it seems that over -- we have a great deal of satisfaction from passengers who utilize that type of screening. there are limitations to the magnatrometers. they can pick up keys and other prohibited items like liquids and c-4, potential explosives. it will be detected under the whole body imaging technologybut not under a magnatometer. the privacy concerns that have been raised, while i understand them, i think they have been overstated. there are strong, strong restrictions in place to make sure that those individuals, the trngs security officer who actually helps the passenger go through the whole body imaging scanning is not in contact with the person who is actually viewing the image in a separate room.   they're separated. the face of the individual is also blurred so that's another protection. so i do think that this technology is very valuable. it will help make us safer. and, again, i think it is a step in the right direction. so i would, again, reluctantly oppose the amendment. i understand the concerns expressed. i believe this technology is valuable and enhances security. at this time i'd like to yield time to the gentleman from california, mr. lungren, whopreviously served as the ranking member on the infrastructure protection and transportation security subcommittee. the chair: how much time does the gentleman from pennsylvania yield him? mr. dent: i yield him as much time as he may consume. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. lungren: i rise in opposition to this amendment. i happen to be one of those people who happens to have an artificial hip. every time i go through i set off the screener. every time i go through i get hand patted down. and even though they do it in a very nice way, frankly that's   far more intrusive than going out to reagan national airport and going through that particular system that we're talking about with those pictures. we have been working for many years since 9/11 to try and come up with devices which will allow us to be able to detect those kinds of things that have brought on airliners would be a threat to all passengers. the whole body imaging technology, which thisamendment seeks to stop in terms of its application as a primary means of screening can detect many things such as small i.e.d.'s, plastic explosives, ceramic knives and other things that traditional metal detection couldn't detect. let me underscore that. this device that this amendment seeks to take off the table as a primary means of screening   can detect small i.e.d.'s, plastic explosives, is he ramic knives and other objects that traditional metal detection cannot detect. that ought to be enough for us to understand this. and if you look at the privacy questions, let's be clear. the person who actually is there, the employee of t.s.a. who is there when you go through this machine is not the one who reads the picture. that person, he or she, is another room, isolated, theynever see you. they actually talk to them by way of radio. so this idea that somebody is sitting in this little room waiting to see what you look like frankly is sort of overblown. and all i can say is this. i have been through many, many patdowns because i happen to have an artificial hip. going through this at national -- reagan national airport was so much quicker, so less intrucive, so less intrucive of   my privacy than what we go through now. and for us to sit here now and pass an amendment which is going to stop this development and application frankly i think is misguided. and with all due respect to the gentleman from utah, who i know is sincere about that, and the gentlelady who is also sincere, i would ask you to rethink this. from my experience this is far more protective of my privacy than what i have to go through every time i have to go to the","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN : June 4, 2009 2:30pm-3:00pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

to bring the legislation to the floor they can unemployment rate ranged from 5.4% and 6%, relatively low. during the 107th congress, when the republicans refused to bring this legislation to the floor again, the unemployment rate never rose above 6% and was below 4.5% for most of the year. during the 106th congress, when the republicans again refused to bring this legislation to the floor, the unemployment   rate never rose above 4.4%. so there's a whole history here of my esteemed colleagues on the other side of the aisle opposing this bill during good times and, you know, average times, and now in lousy times. but that is not the underlying reason they're opposeding the bill. the evidence does not support that. at this time, i'd like to yield three minutes to the lead sponsor of this bill, who hasbeen there for the entire 15 years fighting for this measure, representative carolyn maloney, our chairwoman from the 14th district of new york, again for three minutes. the chair: the gentlelady is recognized. . mrs. maloney: i would like to thank all of my colleagues who have supported this on both sides of the while and overwhelming passage in the past congress and today, especially majority leader steny hoyer, who   with me, introduced this bill 15 years ago. and chairman towns, who has led our committee so well and ranking member wolf, davis, lynch and former congressman tom davis for all of their leadership on this issue. we are here today to show that this congress doesn't just talk about family values, it values families. and this bill, h.r. 626, that grants four weeks of paid leavefor the birth or fostering or adoption of a child is the first bill to pass balancing work and families since 1993. in 1993, we passed the landmark family and medical leave act that provided 12 weeks of unpaid leave which allowed women to have children and not lose their jobs and this is very important since most women have to work, many are single heads of house holds, but it takes two-family   incomes to make ends meet. this bill provides four weeks of paid leave. many on the other side of the aisle have said that this economy is in recession and we should not be doing this. but i would like to point out in addition to the points that mr. lynch made earlier, that they have been opposed to it in good times and bad times. paid leave ensures that the birth of a child does not further destabilize families who are struggling to make ends meetduring these troubled times. during this recession, working families need all the help they can get. 11.6 million americans are unemployed today, which means every paycheck counts more than ever. many are struggling to float on two incomes and many of those families are now scrambling to pay the bills on just one income. without paid leave, the birth of a child means many working   families are left with no income at all. by extending benefits to federal workers, we can diminish the risk of real economic hardship for the 1.8 million employees of america's largest employer, the federal government. a new parent spends an average of $11,000 in additional spending in the first two years of a child's life, according to a study by the u.s. department of agriculture. by ensuring that families'incomes remain steady while a parent is at home taking care of a new child, paid leave ensures that new parents' consumption remains steady, too. this drives economic growth, which is precisely what our economy needs to recover. in a downturn, workers take parental leave without pay and are at risk of serious financial hardship. they may qualify for state benefits, which places   additional burdens on our systems which is already strained by ballooning case loads. i would like to place in the record the remaining parts of my comments. the chair: without objection, so ordered. the gentleman from california. mr. issa: at this time, i would like to three minutes to the the gentleman from from ohio, ranking subcommittee member and somebody who has worked very hard in trying to make this bill better, mr. jordan. the chair: the gentleman is recognized.mr. jordan: i thank the gentleman for yielding and his work on this issue and many others. on monday, june 1, 2009 in ontario, ohio in our district, 1,200 general motors employees found out they were losing their jobs. the obama task force said 1,200 families will face the consequences of unemployment. we are ready to pass another $1 billion entitlement for federal   employees where millions are struggling with joblessness, it is unconscionable that this congress puts more spending on the backs of american families and businesses at a time when taxpayers have to fighten their belts, we are asking for an additional $1 billion. federal employees are entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period because of a birth, adoption or the taking in of a foster child.federal workers can use accrued sick leave and annual vacation leave. if you have been a federal employee for three years, you have at least four weeks of annual leave and 2 1/2 weeks of sick leave each and every year. with this new benefit, we are putting small businesses at a disadvantage. only 57% of private sector -- of the private sector offer any independently defined sick leave. now they will have to compete   for workers against this expanded benefit for government workers. this moves us in the wrong direction. we need to incentivize the private sector, but yet we are expanding the federal government that will crowd out the private sector and stifle innovation and entrepreneurship. the american people are watching us. they expect their government to do exactly what they have done, cut the waste and tighten their belts. that is the message i have heard all across our district and fromfamilies who are experiencing unemployment and small businesses who have had to shut their doors. this congress continues to spend and spend and spend. rather than taking steps to improve the economy to create jobs for the 14 million unemployed americans, we are giving a better deal to the 2.7 million people who are already employed in the federal sector. this is the wrong message to send and i encourage my colleagues to vote against this legislation. i yield back. the chair: the gentleman yields   back the balance of his time. the gentleman from massachusetts. mr. lynch: i would like to yield at this time three minutes to the chairman -- full chairman of our committee,ed towns of brooklyn, for three minutes. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. towns: i would like to thank the federal work force subcommittee chairman, mr. lynch, for the outstanding job that he has done. i would like to thank congresswoman maloney for her leadership on this issue.i would like to thank the majority leader, steny hoyer, for his work on it. and i would like to thank congressman connellly for his work as well. the the gentlewoman from from new york has worked tirelessly to make the federal government an environment that is supportive of working mothers and fathers. i want to thank her for her efforts. and may i add, a job well done. we need to recognize that the federal government is the largest employer in the united   states and that it is -- its policies should set the tone for the country. h.r. 626 provides federal employees with four weeks of paid parental leave for the simple reason that no employee should have to choose between caring for a new child or their paycheck. by providing four weeks of paid parental leave, h.r. 626 makes a strategic investment in thefederal work force. this bill will help the government recruit and retain young talented employees. as the federal government prepares for a wave of upcoming retirements, we need to attract this segment of the population to help us take on some of the challenges facing this country.   this bill also provides potential cost savings to the american people. the taxpayers directly benefit when the government retains existing employees rather than having to hire, retrain, hire, retrain. that is expensive. and let me also add the country is better served by an experienced and productivefederal worker that is able to adequately provide for the health and well-being of the newborn or newly adopted child. the long-term societal benefits of promoting healthy families and early child development are enormous. we in the federal government have a unique obligation to set an example for the rest of the nation, both in the values that we promote and in the way we responsibly manage taxpayers' funded programs. this bill accomplishes both goals. it benefits children and   families and will enable us to recruit and retain top-notch federal employees whose work benefits the entire nation. for all these reasons, i urge all of the members to support this family-friendly legislation that says to the world, we care about our children. the chair: the gentleman from california. mr. issa: thank you, madamchair. i would like to yield three minutes to the the gentleman from indiana, mr. souder. the chair: the gentleman from indiana is recognized. mr. souder: i thank my friend mr. issa for his time and leadership here. in an earlier life of mine when i was with the children and family select committee back in the 1980's, my then boss dan coates was one of the members   that supported the family medical leave bill which i didn't degree with. he told me i could sit in on all the meetings, people said it will never be paid, this is just to cover people for unpaid. you are a paranoid conservative because you hear talk about becoming paid. we watched this in the government arena and my daughter just had our second grandchild. she is a school teacher. the struggle was how was she going to deal with the time shewas going to take off, was it going to be paid, during the school year, what happens when you have grants and she has two little kids, how do you this. what's fair? my oldest son and his wife both work in the government. they would love to have paid medical leave, but there are some problems here. it's one of the most   controversial problems is what to do with the husband and should he be able to get time off during -- when a baby is born, forget all the medical questions. what do we do with air traffic controllers? what do we do with d.e.a. agents who may be making in the final bust in a drug case, what about homeland security where they have been working two years on a case and the wife has a baby, dothey take sudden leave? there are very complicated, fundamental questions in the challenge of how this would prackally work. the second challenge -- practically work. the second challenge is, in case people haven't heard, we have been obligating a lot of future debt and the question is is this the time that the federal government should be doing something that is, quite frankly, generous and help families, but do we have the money to do this?   i represent the number one manufacturing district in the united states. i imagine and my best counting, fort wayne, the biggest city, has 9.5% unemployment rate. others, 12.2. mobile county, 16.5, and elk heart county, 17.4.and i'm supposed to go back to my district and say that government employees are going to get paid parental leave when they're looking at how they get unemployment and how they ever get a job -- would the gentleman yield me another minute? mr. issa: i yield an additional one minute to the gentleman. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. souder: generosity and kindness to families is important. but we also have to ball answer, is this going to be -- balance,   is this going to be mandated in the private sector. do we have the money to do this. and lastly, is this the time to while millions of people are laid off, where others don't know how they are going to pay their house payment, how they're go to go pay their basic health care to say we in the federal government are going to be generous with our employees and give them paid parental leave with their tax money?i yield back. the chair: the gentleman yields back. the gentleman from massachusetts. mr. lynch: thank you, madam speaker. at this time, i would like to yield two minutes to one of our newest, but most energetic and dynamic members of the subcommittee, mr. connolly from the 11th district of virginia.   mr. connolly: i thank mr. lynch. madam speaker, i thought we had identified an issue where we can count on the support of the minority party. after enduring decades of speeches about family values, here wer poised to take action. h.r. 626, the paid parental leave act would allow federally employed mothers and fathers to spend time with their newbornchildren without sacrificing their income. the minority party objects to such a notion. and the committee on oversight and reform, the minority proposed during markup to prohibit paid parental leave from being used for foster children. i can't even speculate about what the origins of that towards foster children might be but i'm reminded about a speech made in this chamber made not so long by the former republican leader,   tom delay. he spoke about the plight of foster children and implored congress to quote, listen to the stories of these children and the stories they tell. study the broken system we have created for them and help them, for god's sake help them, unquote. . madam speaker, h.r. 626 won't solve all or even most problemswith the foster system, but will allow government employees to spend more time with foster children. we have a wealth of evidence that this is essential for the cognitive development of these children. yet the minority party introduced amendments that would hurt foster children. and now the minority wants to gut the legislation to prevent mothers and fathers from   spending time with their young children. this is what real family values are all about. i ask my colleagues to support the bill. the chair: the gentleman from california. mr. issa: at this time, i'd like to yield three minutes to the gentleman from illinois, not texas, mr. schock of illinois.three minutes. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. schock: i rise in opposition to house resolution 626. what we do here in the united states house and the united states congress sets as predon't, -- precedent, not only for the people we employee as a federal government but also who small businesses and large businesses around our country employee. the standards we set, the expectations we have in terms of benefits. and i, like everyone else, enjoy federal benefits.   my employees here as a member of congress enjoy our great benefits plan. unfortunately, back home in central illinois, my individuals there are not employed by the federal government. by and large, they're employed by the private sector. and unfortunately for them, this is a time for them not looking to expand their benefit programs, not going to their employers, asking for more. but they're thankful for the paycheck they've go and --they've got. it seems to me a little disingenuous by those in support of the legislation that at a time we're talking about stimulating the economy, we're talking about feeling the pain of the american people, that we know the truth that our constituents are having to do the opposite. wire having to cut back, they're having to do with less. this bill, and this measure, seeks to do the opposite. expanding four weeks of paid   parental leave will not only add a cost to the federal government by the congressional budget office's own figures of $1 billion in cost over the next five years, but it'll undoubtedly set a precedent for the private sector. unfortunately for the private sector, they cannot print the money or tax the american people to pay for their benefit. the unemployment rate in my state of illinois is just over 9% as of april. this includes over 24,000 jobslaid off by my hometown employer, caterpillar. when i go back there this weekend, i will not be able to tell those individuals, not only are they unemployed, not only do they not have a job, but my colleagues decided our employee, who have not felt the economic downturn, not only get to keep their job but have added benefits at the expense of them as taxpayers. i don't know how we can   honestly vote for more benefits, more pay, and more cost to the federal budget at the expense of taxpayers and those people who are cutting back and losing their jobs. i urge a no vote and yield back the rest of my time. the chair: the gentleman from massachusetts. mr. lynch: madam speaker, i'dlike to at this point yield two minutes to the gentlelady from california's sixth district, ms. woolsey. the chair: the gentlelady is recognized. ms. woolsey:. -- ms. woolsey: madam chairwoman, america should be a world leader in helping parents balance their work and family responsibilities.   as the chairwoman of the house committee on work force protections, i find it totally unacceptable that the country i live in, the united states of america, is one of only four countries not providing paid leave to new mothers and fathers. today in the united states, 51% of new parents don't have paid leave. so as a result, some system -- some take unpaid leave if they can afford it.some quit and some are fired for taking too much time off. that's why i strongly support h.r. 626, so it will -- we can ensure the federal employees won't be forced to choose between their paychecks and their families and one of the most -- at one of the most important times of their lives, the birth or the adoption of a child. investing in our working families is the best way, the best way to strengthen our work   force. it is the best way to stimulate our economy. and it is the best way to strengthen our country. so madam chairwoman, i ask my colleagues to join me in voting for this important legislation authored by congresswoman maloney, support working families. don't force them to choose between putting food on the table and sitting at the tableand having dinner with their children and getting to bond with their new baby. vote for this legislation because the united states of america needs to stand proud among other countries in this world. thank you. the chair: the gentlelady yields back. the gentleman from california. mr. issa: i trust the gentlelady from california was only misunderstood or misspoken when she said someone would lose their job for taking parental leave. that would be a crime under the   1993 act. i would yield to the gentlelady to correct that ms. woolsey: i said for taking too much time off, beyond the family medical leave -- mr. issa: beyond the family and medical leave act. i'd like to yield four minutes to the gentleman from texas. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. >> i rise in opposition to this legislation. it offers a new $1 billionbenefit to federal workers. madam chair, i have no doubt that the federal workers deserve this benefit. but to nonfederal workers, they don't deserve to have their paychecks docked $1 billion to pay for it. that's if the nonfederal government workers are fortunate enough to still have their jobs in this troubled economy. again, it's a great benefit.   i wish every new parent could have that. i want to create a more prosperous economy in america so every american could enjoy it. but madam chairman, this is absolutely nothing more than a wealth transfer of a billion dollars from nonfederal government workers to federal workers. it is just patently, patently unfair. i mean, why would you want to dock the pay of everybody elsein this troubled economy to pay for this? you know, already, if you look at the benefits that federal government employees receive and listen, there are great federal employees. immaterial to keep them. and many of them are incredibly dedicated public servants. but look at the annual leave of the federal government versus the annual leave on average in the private sector, and federal workers are already receiving a   better deal, look at the annual sick leave of federal government compared to the average sick leave in the private sector. the federal government workers are already receiving a better deal. look at the family medical leave. you can see that federal government workers already receive on average a better deal than those in the private sector. so again, when they're enjoying on average greater benefits, enjoying greater job security, what a slap in the face of every worker in america whodoesn't receive a government paycheck to say that all of a sud, they're going to have to pay for a -- all of a sudden, they're going to have to pay for a new benefit for federal workers. this is on top of the fact that the federal government is already having to borrow 46 cents on the dollar. we are awash in red ink. already, this body, under democratic control, passed a budget that will triple the   national debt in 10 years, costing taxpayers $148,926 per household. triple the national debt in the next 10 years. we are about to see more debt placed on this nation, more debt in the next 10 years than in the previous 220. you know, madam chair, there was a time in america's history where you worked hard today so that your children could have abetter life tomorrow. instead, a bill like this is saying, you know what? let's go ahead and let the government work easy today so that our children have to work even harder tomorrow. again, it's just unfair to everyby who doesn't receive that federal government paycheck. you know, at some point, madam chair, you have to say when   does the debt, when does the spending stop? you know, we will never run out of good ideas. we will never run out of opportunities to take money away from one group of citizens and give it to another group of citizens. those opportunities are there each and every day. but again, if you care about all the children in america, you will quit placing an unconscionable burden of debt upon them system of this bill must be rejected out of fairness and out of fiscalresponsibility. the chair: the gentleman from massachusetts. mr. lynch: madam speaker, at this point i'd like to yield one minute to the representative from maryland's fourth district, donna edwards. the chair: the gentlelady is recognized. ms. edwards: thank you, madam chair. i rise in support of h.r. 626, the federal employees' paid parental leave act of 2009. i'd like to thank the gentlewoman from new york, mrs. maloney, for her long-time leadership on this legislation and her ongoing efforts to ensure family-friendly   workplaces and that must begin at least with the federal government. it is so tiresome and tedious to stand on this floor every day and listen to the demagoguing of federal employees people who get up and inspect our food and make sure we have clean water and do all the business they process social security checks, all the business of this government. it is so sad that even on offering a simple parental leave act that we have to demagogue federal employees in the process. the legislation provides fourweeks of paid parental leave for new mothers and fathers for the birth, adoption, or fostering of a child. america's 1.8 million federal employees will benefit from this time to learn how to care for and bond with their new addition to the family. it's what the private sector, many in the private sector already do. it's what we strive for. the federal government needs to set an example. mr. lynch: i'll yield the gentlelady an additional minute. the chair: the gentlelady is   recognized. ms. edwards: this will also help employee morale and allow the federal government to retain young and talented employees in our aging work force. madam chair as a representative of the fourth congressional district of maryland and proudly home to federal employees, more than 1/4 of the federal work force, my neighbors, my friends, people who work hard every day this important legislation will advance family friendly policies and allow the new parents the time necessa","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN : June 4, 2009

i don't want to mention what happened during, at this time and what happened at the airport. the only thing i want to say is our ties were severed. he performed in a way that ties were severed for coats zetia arabia got totally severed, and i am amazed. he is worried about saudiarabia. he was writing articles and using harsh criticisms. some of our friends, who are now working in the electoral campaign committee, they never believed in such things. regarding the occupied palestine, he assumes that we should remember his own stances in the past. so, mr. mousavi had exclusively   announced we would send military forces to go stand alongside the palestinian resistance group to fight against the occupiers and so mousavi announced the zionist regime must be wiped out. but mr. mousavi, we are not going to talk about tactics. we will go the wrong way. the general diplomacy today is the most of advanced and scientific, diplomaticdiplomacy. the enemy has captured the main positions in the world and if we are going to go play in his field, then we will definitely face failure. that is what happened during mr. hisham a's government during mr. mousavi's government. we acted outside of his formulation and this is what he taught us. never accepted the formulations.   had we accepted their formulations we could have never started a revolution. regarding the nuclear program, you definitely know that what was adopted by the previous government in the name of removing tension, it reached a point where our nuclear legislations were totally shot down. there were two contracts imposed on other people then, the additional protocol was one of them without parliament's ratification which is against constitutional law and thesecond one was the executive arrangements. the additional protocol case, international negotiation agencies are free to inspect any part of iran any time they wish to and the goal is to check out our defense capability and give the intelligence to our enemy. the second issue in the executive arrangements, they said that if there is any thought, any ideas in the minds of scientists, nuclear scientist   before taking any action the agency should be informed about this. there and-- nothing worse than this could be imposed on the nation. we can't have any activities 180 days. the nuclear installations will her shut down. all of them were sealed off. to contracts were imposed, and within that time, newinformation-- seven resolutions of board of governors were issued against us were as retreat was the absolute. that resolution is more important than the u.s. security council resolution. it is only political what happens to the u.n. security council but the board of governors of the iaea, the resolution is finding legally and appliances to do certain things.   all the claims made by the atomic energy agency during this government were settled and we have drafted a letter from ipa ee explaining the basic issues are solved and americans raises-- following and whenever gave recognition to that. islamabad, brussels, what happened there? today we are nuclear.free centrifuges, if you look at the memos of our meetings, you can see we have 7,000 centrifuges working now. mr. bush, after all this cooperation, iran had with afghanistan and axis of evil, and nothing happened to iran's dignity. e fred nigh bandwith military attack but what about now?   mr. bush, during his last days said we are not after toppling the islamic establishment. mr. obama expressly said in 27 years and during your government mr. qahtani, america which toppling the establishment. today they announced they are not after this. which foreign policy has been more successful? which has created, which is brought humiliation for thisnation? which foreign policy preserve our independence? which gave more concessions? for 15 years the european said we want to criticize the iran aunt raise issues that iran is not observing human rights. asking two questions about the holocaust into questions, to questions-- the whole human rights system in the west.   they are crying, the israelis are shouting in the people in the west are shutting. some people say i have rans dignity is being pushed. how can you say that? how can we wait till the enemy comes to our soil? today the threat is not directed at iran. of course all of this is thanks to people steadfastness and the sacrifices of the great nation of iran, and the leadership, andi am surprised-- takes a trip outside of adarand and can see how he is greeted by governments and nations. how many performances did he make as prime minister? was iran humiliated then? in the eyes of our willing powers, it was not so. if mr. mousavi thinks we should try to favor and please three or   four major powers this is against the late imam's ideas and the values of the islamic revolution. if we are going to have ties with the great masses of people and governments around the world, a great number of foreign dignitaries and personalities traveled to iran in the past four years. 118 members supported-- >> mr. ahmadinejad your time isover. >> the iranians election takes place on friday, june 12. you can watch more of c-span's international coverage at any time by visiting our web site, c-span.org.these these men, created in 1979 by the cable television industry. but come up with the commercials, how is c-span funded? >> federal funding? >> from dollars and stuff like that? the dalmations. >> publicly but the most part. >> i think there's some congressional appropriations. >> from cable providers. >> america's cable pun companies have been providing programming for 30 years, commercial free as a public service.>> next, the federal communications commission holds a news conference on the digital tv transition. after next friday, june 12, of   free broadcast tv signals will be digital requiring a converter box for analog tv sets. this is 20 minutes. >> the e-mail is dtv countdown at fcc.gov. mark let me know if there are questions that come in and in the meantime we will go ahead and proceed.you may direct your questions to the chairman or any of the commissioners or they will feel free to jump in on the question. please identify your name and affiliation for the benefit of the people who are watching this on the web so who would like to ask the first question? >> for those of you who don't know, fawn johnson of dow jones. a question on the 35 stations that will go dark after june   june 12th. do we know who they are, what company, especially the one that is going into bankruptcy, which company that is coming any detail about those? >> i am sure we know that. i don't personally know that. >> somebody must know. >> yes, we do have that information and actually some ofit is indicated on our master list but i think for everybody's convenience what we are going to be doing is posting a full list of the 35. >> i don't think we need to go through here. >> i just want to let you know we would be posting nasa you'll be able to see that. >> you said there were 18 of those stations are owned by a single company going into bankruptcy, and the rest are going dark because of technical   reasons? >> 18 of them have financial reasons. i believe 17 of those are one particular company. 16 of them are construction issues that will be resolved i believe by the end of the year. some of them a lot sooner, and one of them has a construction permit pending with us that we are looking at, because there is an issue that needs to be resolved.>> puerto rico has a large analog yours. i think the last that i checked was half the households. how is it going there? >> i have been out of puerto rico and they have made huge strides. they have a wonderful person down there who has done a lot of good work but they have a far way to go and i'm afraid there still are a large number of people that are unprepared and puerto rico. despite our best efforts. it was 50% over the air at the   beginning of the transition, which was the highest in the united states and so even though we have cut that down considerably, just as the rest of the country, when a cut in half the bad luck from 73, there is some went-- went from 50 to 25. the number now is still unacceptably high. the broadcasters and puerto rico have done everything they can. everybody has been informed that is watching television that this is coming. i understand there are enoughboxes in, on the island. one of the concerns early on was whether there would be enough boxes. there seems to be an adequate supply. there is adequate information. people are unfortunately waiting, some of them until the last minute but the problem is in puerto rico when this same proportion of people that are unprepared wait it is a much larger number overall because they started at 50%, so we have a bit of a challenge there. i think it is going to be more   disruptive than puerto rico than almost anywhere else in the country because of the large number of over the air but we have resources on the ground to deal with that. it is going to be a little bit messy and i'm hopeful that we can overtime deal with that over the weeks following the transition. >> do you have a number, the current number? >> do you have the nelson number? we don't have a. troy, can you give back to himon that? >> we can get back to you. >> paul. >> paul kirby with tr daily. have you got any sense, i know mr. mcdowell is talking about when congress will approve the other 25 million. the request was made yesterday. have you gotten any sense i guess from commerce rick ntia when they will likely get back to you all? >> no, obviously we are hoping it will be sin.   i am fairly confident that things are on track. i don't see a huge problem here to be dealt with but i am going to be doing everything i can to make sure that is expedited. do we have any questions in my line? >> right now from john egger ten at broadcasting and cable. he says one group says that lots of the converter boxes won't be able to get the dtv signal because the propagation problems that require rooftop antennas.calling that a ""fatal flaw in the transition."" how do you you respond? >> i don't know that i heard it quite that way with generic box is being singled out. >> i think what he means is that, that there is a problem with propagation of the digital signal. >> there's no question about   that. that is why i took pains to discuss that. i think that is an area where the commission really needs to conduct itself with great candor. there are problems. i think the witnesses have made that clear, mr. donovan and others today. there are going to be some cases where people are going to lose signals through perhaps no fault of their own and maybe they are infringe areas are in the areas outside of the market itself, outside of the dma but they arestill going to be inconvenienced and less than pleased about that. there might be some who lose that signal who are right in the middle of the market. we are going to find that up. that is why i am saying, if we have the kind of effort on this-- he would have to go back a couple of years to start testing these and make sure the broadcasters and everybody is coordinated into it in a transitional phase. so,, so we are hoping it is not going to be a major problem that   people are going to need to understand, as the witnesses said, this is a sensitive transition dealing with sensitive technology. all of the kings are not going to be worked out. we probably could delay this for two more years and you are still going to have some of these things that are not going to be worked out because they are just going to take some time. the commission sat for so long in distributed transmission systems and all the rest, so it is catch up and we are all goingto have to be a little patient. i am hoping by and large it is going to be a win for most consumers. i think it will be a win for most consumers. they will get more free, over the air broadcast, a better picture and all of that. more people will be happy probably then will be inconvenienced but we will be hearing from the inconvenienced i am sure. >> not to minimize the problem but certainly many people are going to the signals but more going to gain signals that they did not have. one of the things we can't   emphasize enough is, as the chairman said we are not going to hear from the people that get signals or much sharper pictures where they previously had a weak one but under our analysis there will be more people that will benefit from getting stations that are going to lose that. of course we will hear from the people that lose them but overall the public interest is served not only because of the improved quality of picture and everything else but the return of the spectrum we were able to use for public safety in meeting the demand for wirelessbroadband. >> how big a problem with the-- how big a of a problem with you have if you don't receive the $10 million from the commerce department to help with the cullen centers? >> it is impossible to precisely predict that because we don't know all of the problems that are going to occur but as they said in my remarks during the course of the meeting today i would rather be over preparer than under prepared. it is very, very easy for me to envision a scenario where we would be unprepared. if we don't have the money in   the calls really start coming in, not just freddie but people get back from the long weekend and monday and tuesday or wednesday and we don't have a sufficient number of operators, to take the calls and answer the questions, then there is going to be great consumer dissatisfaction and the potential for considerable backlash, so we don't need to take that risk. the money has been provided by the congress. this is a high priority for the utilization and of that money.as rob said, it is the lifeline, the last lifeline for people is that call center and we have got to make sure it is up and running and running well. rob, i don't know if you want to add anything to the. >> i think it is absolutely vital we get the money from the call center and it is a concern, if there is a concern from the department of commerce regarding how to fund that they can cut back the coupon program to make only over the air households   eligible for coupons. and that would result in a big net cost savings. but that's a million dollars i think is squarely within the intent of the statute within congress's intent four communities out creach and community and consumer education. >> moot i might point out, under the terms of the way things are, that if we don't need that money come in and don't need that level, we can ramp down and won't have to spend that money so it is not that we are sayinggive us $10 million we are definitely going to spend it all or we are going to keep 4,000 operators on line from here to eternity or anything like that. we are going to try to respond to the needs of the moment and the needs of the hour and don't need those resources than we will cut back those resources. that to strikes me as sound, good management won a one. >> cheryl, you had a question. >> june 12th is a friday, and so a lot of this fallout is going to be over the weekend.   was that on purpose, that a friday date was picked and will that cause any problems? what are you guys doing over the weekend? [laughter] >> it is my birthday on the 14th. >> we will be here on the 12 a we will be here i am sure on the 13th and available and we will this have to see the measure of the problem, the magnitude of the problem. what was the first part? >> what is the frauded victim purpose? bead we did not set that date.congress established that they but i think looking at it, it is not a bad day. someone will have a problem with annie dave the week. >> the call center will be open? >> absolutely. >> mr. chairman can we ask you to keep the air-conditioning on of the weekend? >> we are already doing that. >> see would agree to administrator he is. >> i do have a question for the commissioners and a follow-up for eloise.   for all the commissioners, how concerned are you that essentially 18 stations, i don't know if they are handing in their licenses will not be broadcasting. there will no longer be a primary signal. aidid bannack concern for some time both in canada and the u.s. that some tv stations would stop broadcasting altogether. it seems like essentially what we are seeing so how concerned are each of you about that? >> i am concerned whenever anybroadcast station goes dark, or shuts its operations down in terms of diversity and competition that you heard me talk about until i am blue in the face. the disappearance of another newsroom or whatever, that is a net loss for the american people, no question about it. >> i am very concerned as well. i think it is almost a perfect storm for the broadcasting.   it is an unprecedented downturn in revenue due to a number of different trends in the economy. all, together at the same time as the cost of the digital conversion, and this is one of the tragic consequences for the viewers of those stations, that they are going to lose those signals. i think it is very unfortunate and i'm not sure it is the last we are going to here on broadcasters shutting down, given the difficulty of the industry unless the economy turns around pretty quickly.>> i am very concerned. i think it's actually just the beginning of what we might be hearing, more bad news coming over the horizon. if you think many broadcasters rely on auto dealers for about 30% of their ad revenue, and now we have thousands of auto dealers being shattered all across the country, i think it is going to cause a new wave of pain for broadcasters all across the country, so vocally, going   forward to the commission will take the extreme economic arrests being experienced by broadcasters into consideration as it makes new policy. >> jonathan, you had one more? >> just a couple of housekeeping questions. you mentioned the master list. what is that? >> that is an internal term but there is a list on the web site that provides, a spreadsheet, and excel spreadsheet that provides information about thestations, when they are transitioning for example, what time of day they are transitioning. i know we could follow up and give you the exact link to it but you can get it from the first page of dtv.gov or by going into the listings for the station, so i apologize. what i was saying was that to make it convenient for everyone, i think we are planning on posting a separate sheet that lists the 35 stations.   >> can you tell us, you don't need to go through the markets but what is the broadcast? it is 17 of these 18 stations. i think there's a couple of broadcast chains and bankruptcy so which chain is that? the tribune-- >> equity. it is a company called equity. >> equity media? >> that owns 17 of the 18 stations but i will say if i may, that several of the stations that i was speaking about earlier that are going to be using another stationsmulticasting are of these stations, so whether or not they are all going to be permanently dark is something we don't know at the moment and it is something that everybody is working on and looking at very closely because of the concerns the commissioners have expressed. >> so, what these 18 stations, 17 of which are owned by equity media told the commission as they will no longer broadcasts. that is they will no longer transmit from their antenna after the 12?   they are not actually turning in their broadcast license? >> my understanding is they don't have a digital facility built. i am sorry, i could not answer the question about their license that is at this point. >> let's take one more from the group here and one more from the internet, then we will have to go. >> there are no questions on line so are there any last questions? >> going once, going twice.>> class question. >> we don't necessarily know who will be on the dais but to know what the topic of the next meeting will be? >> we have not announce that. >> will it not be like a post-mortem on dtv? >> we have not announced with the docket will be. >> thank you. >> what happens if say the senate gets its act together and manages to confirm a couple of   people, including mr. macdill before the july recess? does that mean that even with a couple of days preparation that the new commissioner will be chairing the next meeting? >> i rather imagine that would be up for consultation in the oncoming commissions. >> thank you very much. this concludes the press conference. thank you very much commissioners. >> thank you david.

filtered and nonfilterred cigarettes, you may have one manfacturer that controls 70% of the market. because you grandfathered it all in and forbidden f.d.a. from changing it to basically given an unbelievable market share to one company. and you have not allowed any other company in the world to participate because if they weren't sold before february   2007, they can't be sold in the future because as i've discussed earlier, to bring a new product to marketplace, you have to make the claim that new nontobacco user would use the product. yet how can you make that claim if the same provision disallows you from talking to a nontobacco user about whether they would use the product or not? it is a catch-22. yeah, we create add pathway, but we also designed it in a way that you couldn't meet the threshold needed to have anapplication approved. so, very simple. point two of the burr-hagan bill does not give the f.d.a. meaningful authority to require changes in tobacco products. they are 100% correct. nor does h.r. 1256. as a matter of fact, not only does it not allow for changes, it legislates there can't be changes to products that were sold before 2007. if campaign for tobacco-free   kids is trying to reduce risk, the risk of disease and death, and youth use age is, they've supported the wrong bill. the third complaint, the burr-hagan bill will actually harm public health because it perpetuates consumers' misconceptions that they can reduce their risk of disease by switching to so-called low-tar cigarettes. let me say, mr. president, our bill goes farther than the kennedy-waxman legislation bybanning -- banning -- the use of terms like ""light,"" ""ultra light"" or ""medium,"" and bans the use of candy, fruit, or alcohol descript terse, on cigarettes even if not characterizing player. in addition, the risk reduction center is required to establish a relative risk ranking for tobacco and nicotine products annually and disseminate that information to the public.   this preempts any unsubstantiated lower or reduced risk consumer communications by a tobacco manufacturer. in other words, we will require under 1256 the f.d.a. does not have to inform the public about the relative risk of the products that they regulate. so they're not going to share with the american people that if you smoke unfiltered cigarettes it is 100% rifnlg if you smoke filtered cigarettes, it is 90% rifnlgt but if in the substitutethat's being offered, we actually require the harm reduction center annually to print a list of what the risk of the products are that are tobacco-related that they regulate. fourth complaint by the campaign for tobacco-free kids: the burr-hagan bill does not strengthen warning labels in a meaningful way. well, actually, our bill incorporates the same warning levels for cigarettes that are   contained in the kennedy-waxman legislation and requires that they be placed on the bottom 30% -- 30% -- of a cigarette pack, including senator enzi's graphic warning label language. also, our amendment goes further than 1256 by requiring the disclosure of ingredients on the back facing of a tobacco product packaging. let me state what the claim was.the burr-hagan bill does not strengthen warning labels in a meaningful way. now, the only thing i can think is the campaign for tobacco-free kids either did not read high bill or does not know the difference between identical language in 1256 and the burr-hagan substitute. because the wording is actually the same. in addition to that, we require that the ingredients that are in those products be listed on the pack, which i think is   beneficial to consumer choice. fifth, the burr-hagan bill does not adequately protect consumers about misleading claims about tobacco products. once again, our bill requires the same rigorous standards used in h.r. 1256 for review and approve, for reduce risk claims of tobacco products. furthermore, it requires the harm reduction center toestablish and publish a relative risk of tobacco and nicotine products on an annual basis, but unlike kennedy and waxman, this legislation also requires disclosure on individual packs of all ingredients. the last and number six complaint by the campaign for -- kikes me, number six, burr-hagan gives the tobacco industry license to market to youth.   our bill eliminates print advertising. their marketing -- there are marketing prohibitions and restrictions over and above what 1256 does. the last one, the burr-hagan bill gives the tobacco industry an undue influence and creates gridlock on an important scientific advisory committee by giving the tobacco industry the same number of votes -- voting representatives as health professionals and scientists. a 19-member board, 10 healthcare experts, four members of the general public, two representatives of the tobacco manufacturing, one representative of small tobacco manufacturing, one representative of the tobacco growers, one expert on elicit trade of tobacco products -- somehow 14 health care experts, one trade expert can be depicted by the campaign for tobacco-free   kids as being the same number as four tobacco-related members of the advisory board. so clearly 15 without a tie to tobacco, four with a remote tie to tobacco, and the campaign for tobacco-free kids said by giving the tobacco industry the same number of voting representatives as health care professionals and scientists ...mr. president, the american people deserve an honest debate. they deserve the information that's set on one side of a bill or another to be factual. i'm not sure how you can look at 15 individuals in one category and four in another and portray for a minute that that's the same number, but that's what campaign for tobacco-free kids does. if in fact they've misled in the   letter to the committee about 1256 in the substitute, what else haven't they told us or what else have they told us that's not accurate? it brings into question that effort and clearly if they support 1256, the effort is not to reduce the risk of death and disease or youth usage of tobacco products. mr. president, can i inquire as to how much time i have left? the presiding officer: the senator from north carolina has 16 minutes remaining.mr. burr: i thank the chair. mr. president, when i ended talking about the substitute, i had held up this can of come he will orbs. and i -- of camel orbs. i had told the members that that was product that was currently rated at about a 1% risk, a 99% reduction from typical nonfiltered cigarettes and a 89%   reduction -- my math is a little fuzzy after all the time i've spent on the floor -- 89% reduction from nonfiltered cigarettes. i just want to hold up what a dissolvable tobacco. you don't get lung scwer. you don't get copd. doesn't cause heart disease. 1% risk. but under h.r. 1256, thisproduct is outlawed. why? because it wasn't sold between -- before february 2007. now, let me say to my colleagues, if the intent of passing federal regulation over tobacco industry -- and i'm supportive of it -- is to reduce death and disease, why would you exclude a product that has a 1% risk but grandfather in products that have a 100% likelihood of killing you?   even if you're not debating whether it's in the f.d.a. or whether it's in the harm reduction center, how in the world can a member of the united states senate say that it's okay to eliminate the ability for an adult to choose to use this and to be locked in to a certain death? we're supposed to pass policy that makes sense that works forthe american people, that actually does reduce the risk of death, disease, and youth useage of tobacco. when you lock them into the highest risk and likelihood of death, you haven't fulfilled that. when you don't require states to use the money that they were given for cessation programs, how can you expect that you're going to reduce youth usage? when you see that 48 states have   a higher prevalence of marijuana use among youth than they do above tobacco, how can you conclude that just by giving the f.d.a. the jurisdiction to regulate tobacco that somehow that means you're going to have a reduction in youth usage. itit's just not going to havment the american association of public health physicians states that this product orbs are the most effective way to fight death,disease associated with current tobacco users. let me state at that again. the american association of public health physicians states that these are the best tool we have to get people to quit smoking. as a matter of fact, i'm proud to say that the american association of public health physicians yesterday endorsed the substitute amendment and not the base bill. because they recognize the base bill does nothing but provide a   pathway to certain disease or death. just so i'm clear, mr. preside mr. president, under the base bill, h.r. 1256, marlboro is cemented on the retail shelf. camel orbs that reduces death and disease related to tobacco use is band, can't be sold.swedish snus -- it wasn't on the market before february 2007. marlboros are on the shelf. snus? it's banned. even though the swedish experience that i talked about earlier -- during the past 25 years, swedish men showed notable reductions in smoking-related disease, a   decline in lung cancer incidence rate to the lowest of any developed nation, no detectable increase in oral cancer rate, improvement in cardiovascular health, tobacco-related mortality in sweden is among the lowest in the developed world. but in our infinite wisdom in this austere body, we're gettingready to pass a bill that takes a product that sweden used to get people off of cigarettes, that sweden used to reduce lung cancer, that sweden used to bring down cardiovascular disease, that sweden used to reduce mortality by tobacco products, and we're going to eliminate it. and we're going to lock them into everything sweden is going to try to get rid of. think about this before you do   it. for god's sakes, once you pass this, it's too late. mr. president, current cessation programs don't work. i said earlier, those products have a 95% failure rate. given current smokers an opportunity to migrate to a less harmful product, it is a publichealth initiative, not creating a pathway to reduced harmful products. it is not a public health bill. but those products are banned in h.r. 1256. senator hagan's and my amendment allow these products to be marketed and regulated. marketed and regulated. marketed and regulated correctly. our amendment establishes the   tobacco harm reduction center within the office of health and human services. we provide the harm reduction center with the regulatory authority to better protect our children from tobacco use and to significantly increase the public health benefits of tobacco regulation. we require tobacco manufacturers to publish ingredients of products. we require the harm reduction center to rank tobacco products according to their risk of deathand disease. -- risk and disease associated with each type of tobacco product in order to inform the american public more fully about the risk and harm of tobacco products. we ban candy in cigarettes and give the harm reduction center the authority to reduce smoking articles and adjust accordingly if the best interests -- in what   is the best interest of public health. what we don't do is give an already overburdened agency the responsibility to regulate tobacco. now we've had a change in administrations but as supportive as i am of the new commissioner of the f.d.a. f.d.a., she will do a wonderful job, let me turn to the formercommissioner of the f.d.a., two years ago. he gave his opinion on the possibility of f.d.a. regulation for tobacco. ""the provisions in this big,"" and you might say, gosh, there was two years ago, well, i think i've already made a credible case that most of what's in this bill was written 10 years ago, even some of the deadlines that are in the bill haven't been changed since the bill was updated two years ago so i think   it's very credible to use the comments of the former f.d.a. commissioner two years ago. ""the provisions in this bill would require substantial resources and f.d.a. may not be in a position to meet all the activities within the proposes user fee levels~... as a consequence of this f.d.a. may have to divert funds from its other programs, such as addressing the safety of drugs and food, to begin implementing this program."" all of a sudden we're right backwhere i started three days ago. why in the world would we jeopardize the gold standard of the food and drug administration, the agency that provides the confidence to every consumer in the country that when they get hope at night after having a prescription filled that they don't have to worry about whether it's safe? when they go to the doctor or the hospital and they're going to use a device, they aren't going to use something crafted in the back room that nobody reviewed to see if it was safe,   it had the gold standard, the seal of approval of the food and drug administration. that the bu biologics that were created that didn't exist 10 years ago and we could be certain the f.d.a. looked at the new product and approved it for use in humans; that when we went to buy food our food would be safe. do we really want to jeopardizethe f.d.a. having to divert funds from food safety right now when we've had americans that have been killed? to we really want a reviewer at the f.d.a. whose gold standard is to prove safety and efficacy on all the products they regulate except for tobacco, lower their guard and let something through that didn't meet the threshhold of safe and effective? i'm not sure that's in the best interests of america. i'm not sure it's in the best   interests of the american people. my colleague from connecticut came to the floor and said the food and drug administration is the only agency that had the experience, the expertise, and the resources -- well, the commissioner of the food and drug administration said, i don't have the resources. if you give this to me i might have to divert funds from otherprograms. as a matter of fact, they would have to divert people from applying -- from reviewing the applications for new drugs, new biologics. it could be that somebody waiting for a new therapy, dies before the therapy is available because we had to divert funds or people to take care of regulating a product the f.d.a. had never regulated and that commissioners of the f.d.a. told us they didn't have the funds.   i'm not sure how clear we need this. i said when i star started on my this was an uphill climb. the deck was stacked against me. i understood the threshhold was to come to the senate floor and to spend as much time as it took to convince my colleagues, republican and democrat and independent, that this was not abill where one party trumped the other. senator hagan's a democrat, i'm a republican. we've come to the floor passionately with our substitute amendment because we think it trumps h.r. 1256 from a policy standpoint. the american people expect us to pass the right policy, not ""any""   policy. if the f.d.a. is not the appropriate place to put it the american people expect us to find something else that meets the threshhold of the right regulation but doesn't encumber the gold standard of an agency that we're so reliant on. i'm hopeful we're going to have a vote this afternoon on the substitute. it will be next week before the base bill is voted on.let me say to my colleagues, you're only going to have one opportunity to change this bill. that one opportunity is to vote for the substitute amendment. and if you vote for the substitute amendment, you're going to vote for a bill that actually reduces the risk of death and disease for people who choose, adults who choose, to use tobacco products. if you vote for the substitute   you're actually going to vote for a bill that actually reduces youth usage in a real way. if you pass on support of the substitute -- and it will be a close vote -- if you pass on supporting it, you're going to have to live with what you do to the f.d.a. you're going to have to live with the consequences. when i came to the congress, thehouse of representatives, in 1995, i was given the task of modernizing the food and drug administration. we opened up the food and drug administration in its entirety. it took 2~1/2 years to produce a bill. it was a bipartisan bill. as a matter of fact, i think in the united states senate and the house it passed by a voice vote. why did it take 2~1/2 years and two congresses? because we understand, we understood at that time the delicacy of what we were attempting to do. we were attempting to modernize   the agency and to maintain the gold standard. at the end of the day no member of the house or the senate offered an amendment to give the f.d.a. jurisdiction over tobacco. and in 1998 that bill bill law. -- that bill became law. every member knew it wasn't worth of risk of giving them the responsibility of tobacco after spending 2~1/2 years to protect the gold standard. we're not that forgotful.don't forget our commitment to make sure the gold standard of the f.d.a. is intact. don't jeopardize it by giving them tobacco. don't let our kids be sold short by producing a bill that doesn't do the education they need to do the education so they never pick up a tobacco product. don't lock the adults who choose to use risky products, give them an opportunity to have less   harmful products. that can be only done one way. that can only be done if members of the united states senate vote to support the hagan-burr substitute. it does keep kids from smoking. it does preserve the core mission of the f.d.a. it does reduce the risk of death and disease. mr. president, i yield the floor.the presiding officer: the senator from new hampshire.   mrs. shaheen: mr. president, i rise today in support of the family prevention and control act. we all know someone who is currently a smoker, someone who has been a smoker. and i know we all worry about their health. and that's with good reason. tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the united states. it kills more people each year than alcohol, aids, car crashes,illegal drugs, murders and suicides combined. let me repeat that because it's hard to believe, but the fact is, tobacco use kills more people each year than alcohol, aids, car crashes, illegal drugs, murders and suicides -- combined. and tobacco-related health problems affect millions more   resulting in skyrocketing health care costs every year. the cycle of addiction is so hard to break and the tobacco companies work hard to attract smokers with flashy marketing campaigns and by including chemicals that are proven to be addictive. undoubtedly this hurts our nation's overall health. there's no question that one of the most important steps the senate can take to improve health and to reduce costs is toreduce the use of tobacco. that's why this legislation is so important. why i'm proud to be one of the 53 cosponsors of this legislation. again, over half the senate is cosponsoring this legislation. i want to thank senator kennedy for his leadership and work on this important issue over so many years. i thank senator dodd for managing this bill on the floor. throughout my career i have   advocated for smoking prevention. we all realize the cost in lives and in health care expenses that smoking creates. not only to the consumer but also to those who are exposed to the dangerous second-hand smoke. in new hampshire, almost 20% of adults smoke cigarettes. and tobacco-related health care expenses in new hampshire amount to $969 million a year. during my tenure as governor iwas proud to sign legislation that banned the sale of tobacco products to minors, that prohibited the possession of tobacco products by children, and that required the new hampshire department of health and human services to disclose harmful ingredients in tobacco products. the important legislation that we're considering today expands on what new hampshire has done. it will give the f.d.a. the authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco products to   youth. in new hampshire this year alone 6,300 children will try sphwrets for the first time -- try cigarettes for the first time. just over a third of the children will become addicted and become life-long smokers. the tobacco companies know these statistics and target their marketing to this vulnerable population. in fact, published research studies have found that children are three times more sensitive to tobacco advertising thanadults and are more likely to be influenced to smoke by marketing than by peer pressure. this year in new hampshire alone the tobacco companies will spend $128 million on marketing, much of it geared to kids. tobacco companies also attract children to their products by using flavors, flavors such as   twist-a-lime saying they contain hawaiian hints of coconut or winter mocha mint sounds like we're talking aboutic cream o tr candy, not cigarettes. but these i intice to try them tthis makes it easier for the kids to smoke. they don't make cigarettes less dangerous or less addictive. the tobacco companies don't stop at just the flavors to attract kids. they package the products in colorful patterns aimed at attracting children to their products. norma, from new hampshire, reports that her youngest child is 19 and is addicted to   smoking. he buys the mint and fruit-flavored products and by now is smoking up to two packs a day. already, at age 19, he's developed a smokers cough. keith, from concord, an adult, but he is also a victim of childhood addiction. he smoked his first cigarette after a basketball game when he was only 17. recently he was diagn","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 4, 2009 3:30pm-4:00pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

department survey showed that 70% of employees chose not to take unpaid leave because they just couldn't afford it. they certainly cannot do so in the trying economic times we face today when hardworking families are struggling just to get by. no parent should be placed in a position of having to choose between the bond and bonding with their child and foregoing   these formative moment -- and forgoing these formative moments in their child's life to keep a roof over their head or to keep food on their table, especially when the fate of the child is ultimately at stake. s that moral and societal situation that as legislators and parents and protectors of god's children we must get right. the federal government, i believe, has a moral obligation to set the stage for making changes across the table.we need to do more than just help in the care and development of a child. we must take the reins and lead by example. we should be setting the standard in family-friendly workplace policies across the nation, not lagging behind. . h.r. 626 is quite simple. if they wish to be paid, they must use any unused accrued sick   time or vacation time. this bill helps families by providing four weeks of paid parental leave for federal employees for the birth, adoption or fostering of a child and allowing employees to use that accrued vacation or sick time for that parental leave. this is a small change in law that i will entice other employers to follow suit and will have impact on the parentsand well-being of their children. i can speak to this from my own experience. my dear wife kathy and i have three beautiful children, one biologic and two that we adopted out of the foster care system. these children we love as much as if they were our biological daughter. i will tell you from our own experience, by adopting a child, especially out of one out of foster care, it requires care,   attention and additional time for bonding. this is not an option in their case. it is an absolute necessity. our children, in fact, all foster children, have faced and will continue to face significant challenges in their lives from the abuse they incurred when they were in foster care. they will forever carry those unspeakable scars that every parent fears and no child should ever bear.yet, the only hope and chance that you have to save these children is to give them time to bond with those very new parents that are the ones that will be trying to save their lives. and rub aware those scars. there is no choice -- there is no other choice than to immediately give them all the love they can take and more than they have ever known. food, nutrition they need and the health care they have never   had. they need the unflagging support and nurturing that they get from the new adoptive parents in order to establish a pattern of survival in their lives. i also know that without the time to forge this bond immediately after adoption, they have no hope of overcoming the enormous obstacles that they face. madam speaker, you can put a price tag on a piece of legislation, but you cannot put a price on the importance of nothaving to worry about a paycheck and having the full and undivided attention of both parents lavishing endless love on a disadvantaged child. i can think of no gaiter gift that we give as parents. without it, far too many children will slip through the cracks. and for many more, all hope will be lost. as legislators, it is our imperative that we do what is   morally right, not to let hope be lost, but rather to let hope spring eternal and to give these children, who have already have so many things working against them as i mentioned in the case of adoption and foster care the chance at life they deserve. i reserve the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore: the gentleman from texas. mr. sessions: thank you, madam speaker. i want to thank my friend from california for yielding this time to me to discuss theproposed rule consideration for the federal employees paid parental leave act of 2009. and i yield myself such time as i may consume. the speaker pro tempore: the gentleman is recognized. mr. sessions: thank you, madam speaker. i have heard a lot of arguments here on the floor of house of representatives and i'm not a psychologist, but i would tend to bet that probably more than the first 12 weeks of a child's life is very important to their development. and i'm kind of surprised that   we don't have evidence today that says the first 14, 13, 16 years of a child's life is really the most important point. and maybe we just ought to let employees take 16 years off, since that's the defining moment. there is no reality with this about the first 12 weeks of a child's life. it's about probably the first 14 or 15 years. and as a parent, i can tell you,i remember the first 12 weeks. i remember them very vividly for both of my boys. and i'm sure that there is some bit about what my children understood about the bonding with me. let's go straight to this. it's expensive. going to cost a lot of money and it's for federal employees at a time when this federal   government needs to be more efficient and the people of this country cannot afford it. we have done it without these number of years. and i'm surprised that we're doing it today in the economic times that we have. today, i will discuss my opposition to the structured rule, which limits debate and does not provide for the open and honest congress my democrat colleagues have always called for for the past 3 1/2 years. i rise in opposition in putting taxpayers further in debt, thosepeople that don't work for the government, to pay for this new extension of benefits by expanding an already generous government paid leave. the economy is in a recession. hello. hello. wake up, washington. we're in a recession and somebody else is going to have to pay for this. i know it's about the kids. i know it's about this bonding for the first 12 weeks.   unemployment is at a 25-year high. government spending is out of control. and individuals and retirees that have lost trillions in their savings and retirement are now going to have to pay another $1 billion for this plan. the government should be ensuring the future of the economy before taking on additional government benefits to those who have some of the greatest job security at the expense of the people who arepaying for it, called the taxpayer. i rise in opposition to the so-called structured rule and to this legislation, which would provide more government benefits to bureaucrats with benefits in excess of what most hard-working americans in the private sector have. i guess we're supposed to sacrifice a little bit more to make our government employees   get more benefits. madam speaker, as a father of two children, when i return home to my home every weekend. i have never spent a weekend in washington, d.c. i go home and i, like every member of this body loves their family and we understand the importance of family and how strong families are to this country. additionally, i know how hard federal employees work. i honor them for their work andtheir devotion to the people of this country and the devotion to their job. and they do deserve competitive compensation and a good benefits package. at the same time, i believe at this time, this bill sends a wrong message at the wrong time to working americans, their taxpayers and families that they themselves are struggling to sacrifice to give a select few in this government additional   new benefits. in february of this year, my democrat colleagues passed a $1.2 trillion economic stimulus package with absolutely no, zero republican support. this was their failed attempt to provide jobs to the struggling economy. the u.s. has eliminated 663,000 in march alone and an additional536,000 in april. over the past 12 months, the number of unemployed has risen by six million people to 13.7 million and the unemployment rate has grown from 3.9%. we should be thinking about how we're going to struggle to get people employed in this country, not giving additional benefits to government workers. one would think that this massive amount of spending that was done this year by my friends   on the other side would ensure job growth, investment and economic output. instead, the failed policies of the democratic party and of this administration have led to a budget deficit that already has been announced. it's not just $1 trillion. it has now grown to $1.8 trillion. and about $89 billion more than was predicted in the president's budget, nearly four times the record set -- that's right therecord that was set last year by my democrat colleagues of this house. this has ledeen to the president's chief economic advisor, while speaking on cnn to acknowledge that, and i quote, it's pretty reality stick that there will be no -- realistic there will be no job growth until 2010 and the u.s. will hit 5.9% unemployment this   year. let's be honest about it. the democratic plans are there would be 9% unemployment next year. that was the democrats' blueprint, their plan that was in the budget, 9%. that's their best estimate, their guess. we're going to rise to 9%. well, the question is not whether congress should support families, but whether it makessense when so many americans are already struggling with unemployment rates, increased taxes, thanks to our good friends, the democrat majority, and to an economic recession with three years that the house and the senate have been run by democrat leadership, to increase their tax burden to pay for this increased paid time off from work, especially in light of the fact that government workers, in my opinion, have not even asked   for it. madam speaker, my friends on the other side often argue that federal employees need greater benefits to be more competitive with private industry. there could be truth to that. even the office of personnel management have determined that federal and private sector benefits compare favorably and additional benefits would not help with retirement and retention. additionally, this bill does not exist -- assist the older workforce facing retirement since it deals specifically with paid leave for having a child, adopting a child or taking care of a foster child. the congressional budget office estimates that this new benefit in search of a problem will cost taxpayers $938 million over the next five years. madam speaker, at a time when the average, hard-working american families are already   struggling and working many, many, many more hours and trying to find additional income through a job that they cannot find to pay their bills, i don't believe it's appropriate for congress to increase the paid leave of federal bureaucrats beyond their already generous levels and using taxpayer dollars to do it. since june of last year, the federal government work force has grown by 37,000 employees, while the private sector has sedmore than 4.4 million jobs at the same time. my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent trillions of the taxpayers' dollars over the past six months. americans are faced with a $1.8 trillion deficit this year alone from the democrat majority and this administration. their plan. taxpayers are reaching a breaking point when it comes to subsidizing higher federal   spending at their expense. it is costing the free enterprise system jobs and the opportunity to get a job tomorrow because the massive spending that's taking place by this democrat majority. responsible american families are cutting back their costs. they're dealing with the job loss. they're doing the things to help their families and their friends. and they're looking at thedestruction of their savings and retirement accounts. i think it's simply wrong. it's wrong for the democratic party to move this bill rather than trying to create jobs, they're trying to get new benefits for federal employees. madam speaker, i will be honest. darn right this is going to be a tough vote for members of congress. are we going to pay attention to what's happening back home or are we going to come up here and   spend another $1 billion. i urge my colleagues to vote no on this legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore: the gentleman from california. mr. cardoza: thank you, madam speaker. i would just respond to the gentleman that this is less than $100 million a year for the entire country. while every dollar that the taxpayers pays is significant and important, i'd say that this particular bill is much more important in some ways than manyexpenditures this federal government makes. and it is also something that i believe is fundamentally important in many sectors, especially in the area that i talked about with adopting new children. the gentleman says that federal employees is some of the most stable work force we have in this country. well, that is the kind of people you want adopting children, stable homes that have jobs they   aren'toing to lose and take the time to do. while lead policies in the government generally may compare favorably with some private sector employment, the federal government's paid parental leave policy simply does not. 75% of the fortune 100 companies offer at least six weeks of parental paid leave and make them much more attractive toyoung working families who cannot afford to go without pay for that length of time. madam speaker, i would like to yield two minutes to the the gentlewoman from new york, mrs. maloney. the speaker pro tempore: the gentlelady is recognized for two minutes. . mrs. maloney: i rise in strong 130r9 of the bill that would provide for four weeks of paid leave for the birth, adoption, or fostering of a child. it's identical to the version   of the bill that passed the house last congress with strong bipartisan support. the vote count was 278 to 146, with 50 republicans voting for the bill in the 110th congress my good friend on the other side of the aisle said federal employees are not asking for this. that is not the truth. i would like permission to place in the record various letters written in support, they actively have been meeting with us and supporting it forthe past 15 years that majority leader steny hoyer and myself and others have been championing this bill. i'd like to put their letters of support in the record. the speaker pro tempore: without objection, so ordered. mrs. maloney: i also would like to point out that this bill is pay-go neutral and would not affect, and i quote, direct spending or reseats. -- or receipts. to be clear, there are no pay-go implications for h.r. 626 because it does not create   new expenditures. whether or not an employee takes paid leave, the paid for -- pay for that employee has been included in the salary budget for that agency. the only cost associated with the bill is the amounthat agencies currently save when employees who have a new child take their 12 weeks of unpaid leave, and the $140 million for four weeks of paid leave in the congressional budget office score is what federal agenciescurrently save when employees take unpaid leave. paid leave can also offset costs by boosting employee morale and productivity while reducing turnover. turnover is costly. it costs 20% of an employee's salary to hire and train a new worker, compared to just 8% to provide skilled, experienced employee with four weeks of paid parental leave. the military already provides paid leave.   new mothers are provided not with four week, but six weeks of paid leave and fathers are given 10 days. this puts the civilian branch -- the speaker pro tempore: the gentlelady is recognized. mrs. maloney: this bill puts the civilian branch on par with the military. it's already been pointed out that a large portion of the private sector voluntarily provides paid leave, and in a study by harvard and by the g.a.o., we found that we are ranked 168th in the world, 168countries provide some form of paid leave. we are tied wit papua, new gun nee, swaziland, and lesotho, as countries that do not provide paid leave. this is an opportunity for this body that constantly talks about family values to show they truly do value families and provide paid leave, four   week, building on the 12 weeks of unpaid leave, that families can have support in this critical time of the birth, adoption, or fostering of a child. i believe my time has expired. i urge a yes vote on the rule and i urge a yes vote on the underlying bill. the speaker pro tempore: the gentlelady yields back. the gentleman from texas. mr. sessions: thank you, madam speaker. madam speaker we had two wonderful speakers on the majority said tell us, i think they were contradicting eachother, one said, it only costs $100 million a year. another speaker said, there's no cost. as a matter of fact, pay-go says there's nothing to it. well, maybe the pay-go rules of this house say that, but let me tell you what the congressional budget office says. their cost estimate. congressional budget office says five years, $938 million. $938 million. almost $1 billion over five   years. that's real money. oh, no. no, no, no. you've got it wrong. we are already going to give them the money anyway, so it doesn't cost anymore. that's not reality. that's not the way it works. c.b.o. is right, $938 billion over five years. we had our president just maybe three weeks ago, four weeks ago, say, after spending this -- all these trillions ofdollars, the president said, i'm going to ask my budget to cut a whopping $100 million from all their budgets across government. $100 million. that is this bill, just for one year. as the gentleman says, just one year. with the bottom line is, it's $938 billion over five years. you just can't have it both ways.   you can't try and explain to the american people that you're really trying to do something good for them, but turn around and make it more difficult. i think our friends that are on the majority party don't understand that you just can't sneak up here to washington and do this and get away with it back home. people are going to pay attention to this madam speaker, at this time, i'd like to yield two minutes to the gentleman from kilovis,california, mr. nunes. the speaker pro tempore: the gentleman is recognized. mr. new necessary: i rise in opposition to -- mr. nunes: i rise in opposition to the rule. when our government can't ensure water to the people that live in this country, the government has failed. i want my colleagues to know that this government is previding over a man-made drought in california, thanks to this, my district's at 20% unemployment. some communities are at 50% unemployment.   and despite this crisis, today, the obama administration announced a new biological opinion that will end water deliveries in california. laying waste to billions of dollars worth of infrastructure and starving the state of water. we must not allow this to happen and this body must act. i'd like to conclude by addressing my friends in the democratic leadership in this country. i want to express mycongratulations for dealing with this crisis. you've managed to make the crisis worse. madam speaker we need to stop the spending, stop the bailouts, and get back to the basic responsibilities that this government has, like providing water to people. with that, madam speaker, i urge a no vote on this rule and yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore: the gentleman yields back. the gentleman from california.   mr. cardoza: thank you, madam speaker. i respond to my colleague from california and my colleague from texas in this way. that they -- my colleague from california knows i support him in his efforts to try and solve the california water crisis, and in fact, i've been a leader in trying to do that. i don't always agree, i've come to this house floor and argued with my own leadership with regard to the issues that have dealt with the causes of thecalifornia regulatory drought. i'd also like to remind the gentleman who loves to blame the democrats for everything that goes wrong, that it was a republican bill and a republican judge that put both of those concerns that are causing much of our water problems on the map. with regard to my friend from texas. his claim that this is all about the cost. i can tell you, as an adoptive parent, that if i hadn't take   then actions i did by adopting two children, they would not have fulfilled the place they hold in my heart, but they would have also cost the federal government much, much more. when we allow -- when we take kids out of foster care, and put -- out of a home, abusive home, and put them into foster care we do so in order to try and recapture their lives. my children came out of a homewhere they were being neglected and abused from a drug addicted mother. and the scars that they will carry from that time in their lives are profound. had i not had the ability to spend time with them, the challenges that we face with those emotional difficulties work those young people, they love so much, would be in fact much worse than they are even today.   the gentleman can talk about how this is a cost issue, but let me tell you, people can't get the time to do what's right about adopting young kids, they won't do that. and it will cost the federal government much more. we argued this in a bill last year where we gave the opportunity for our troops to adopt young people and take that leave. it was the right thing to do then and it passed. last year, this bill was on thefloor and 50 of the gentleman's colleagues from texas voted in support of this. this is the right thing to do for our country. it's the right thing to do for our kids. i believe in it profoundly. and yes, this government wastes a lot of money in many different ways, but i can tell you that money spent in this area, on these particular set of young people i've talked about so much today, is money well spent and will pay   dividends many times over in the future. i have no question about that. at this time, madam speaker, i'd like to inquire of the gentleman from texas if he has any remaining speakers. mr. sessions: i thank the gentleman for the inquiry, i do have at least one more speaker. i would anticipate that if you do not have any more speakers, i would then offer my close and then we could allow you to do the same and move on through this rule. mr. cardoza: i would reserveand allow the gentleman to close. the speaker pro tempore: the gentleman from texas. mr. sessions: thank you, madam speaker, i appreciate the opportunity to move forward on this important bill. madam speaker, i'd like to ask unanimous consent to insert into the record the cost estimate for h.r. 626 from the congressional budget office. the speaker pro tempore: without objection, so ordered. mr. sessions: madam speaker, i'd like to ask unanimous consent to have information provided the national -- from the national federation of independent businesses known as   nfib, their information about opposing, strongly opposing this bill. into the record. spro the speaker pro tempore: without objection, so ordered. mr. sessions: at this time, i yield two minutes to the gentleman from new york, mr. lake. mr. lake: i thank the gentleman from texas for yielding and i rise to oppose the rule and legislation in consideration of h.r. 626. having run a business, i understand how important it isto look out for workers and be supportive, especially in these difficult economic times when families are making tough choices with regards to how they spend their money and their time. i believe this debate should be focused on whether we should be granting additional benefits when workers in areas like   where i come from are struggling to hang on to their job. that's why i offered an amendment that says this would not take effect until the national employment rate is down to 4% and no state has an employment rate greater than 7%. i regret the house will not have the opportunity to consider this amendment because i think it provides a common sense way to address the timing of this measure. take an area in my district take an area in my district like niagara county, where tens","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN : June 4, 2009 5:00pm-5:30pm

""we believe the absence of effective harm reductionstrategies for smokers is perverse, unjust, and acts against the rights and the best interests of smokers and public health."" a reputable health publication that basically says the absence of effective harm reduction strategies acts against the rights and public health. but the base bill 1256 has no   effective harm reduction strategy, no pathway to harm reduction products. but they claim to be a public health bill. a health care publication says that can't happen. it's perverse. it's unjust. well, they said it. i didn't. but i think what they mean is that to consider passing h.r.1256 with the knowledge that's been given would be perverse, unjust, i'm not going to have an opportunity to talk fully at this time because i've got a colleague that will take the floor. but, mr. president, let me say i talked earlier about camel orbs and the way that cnn portrayed this product as candy and staged   a news event -- well, news would be -- let's say entertainment event by taking this from behind the counter of a convenience store and putting it in the candy section and having a kid go up and pick the orbs up out of the rack to say that it was candy. oeurbs represents a 99% -- orbs represents a 99% reduction in death and disease associated with tobacco use of cigarettes.i ask my colleagues if the objective of federal legislation is to reduce the risk of death and disease, and nonfiltered cigarettes are 100% and filtered cigarettes are 90% and orbs is 1%, isn't it perverse and unjust not to allow the american consumer to have this product to switch from cigarettes?   i think the answer to the question has already been answered. i yield the floor. the presiding officer: the senator from ohio. mr. brown: thank you, mr. president. i ask unanimous consent to address the house for up to ten minutes. the presiding officer: is there objection? without objection, so ordered. mr. brown: thank you, mr. president. in 1989 was the seminole year in world history, late in the year, november 9, the berlin wall fell. and like dominoes, poland,hungary and czechoslovakia went from being soviet satellites to democracies. the revolution of 1989 would set the tone for the peaceful breakup for the soviet union. the winds of change were bringing democracy in freedom to the oppressed. i look forward to honoring the peaceful revolutions of 1989 later this year. but i want to speak today about the revolution that never was, an event that took place 20 years ago this week in a country   whose people remain subject to totalitarianism and tyranny. a peaceful pro-democracy rally that was snuffed out with the brutality the world hadn't seen since the invasion of czechoslovakia by the ussr in 1968. it started much like the revolutions of 1989. the sixth general secretary of the communist party of china was famous for supporting ideas like political reform and capitalism.not much different from lech walesa of poland or havel of czechoslovakia. when he died on april 151989, thousands of chinese students began a peaceful protest in tennessee square in his honor and call support for -- in tiananmen square. protesters called for nothing more than a dialogue with their government and party leaders on how to combat corruption and how to accelerate economic and   political reforms like freedom of expression and democracy. more than a million people would eventually gather in tiananmen square in the shadow of the forbidden city and the monument in front of chairman mao's mausoleum. that 1 million people that congregated, that was just in bay which i think. protests spread -- in beijing. protests spread across city after city, community after community. on the night of june 3, 1989,15,000 soldiers with armored tanks storm tiananmen square. on june 4 the chinese red army fired upon the protesters and those in the surrounding areas. on june 5, as the crackdown continued, more than 300,000 -- 300,000 -- chinese troops amassed in and around tiananmen square. there the world witnessed one of the pivotal moments of the 20th century, 20 years ago this week when an unknown   protester stood in front of a column of chinese army tanks. he stood alone. surely he wanted the tanks to stop. just as surely he wanted to stop the violent crackdowns. he has become an enduring symbol of freedom and democracy in this country and around the world. but not in china where the image and accounts of the heroic act are banned. attempts to just erase it from history. the identity and fate of this young man are not known.however, it's generally agreed he died in a chinese prison for this brave act of nonviolence. the chinese government continues to deny western estimates of 300 dead and 20,000 arrests and detentions during the ten men crackdown. the u.s. responded to the crack down by suspending all government and military sales, and commercial military sales and all high-level government-to-government exchanges. that was then. we can't go back and change the past, but we can begin to hold   china accountable for its actions. not only does china continue to hold people in jail based on their actions at the ten yen men protest, but the -- tiananmen square protest, but the fear from the crackdowns threatens to remind chinese citizens what they face should they try again to bring reform to their nation. today in beijing, police are on the streets today in and around tiananmen square to preempt, not to control but to preempt any observance of the anniversary. in hong kong, 150,000 peopleshowed up for a candlelight vigil in remembrance of those who died 20 years ago this week. the government shut down much of the internet, including western news sources for fear that its citizens may learn what really happened. the police are using umbrellas to block cameras. it's a spectacle and it's a travesty. for too long the west has looked the other way as china declares a war on human rights. for too long the west has rewarded china with lob sided   trade policies while china continues to carry out a war on minority cultures. the united states should not endorse in any way the brutal and horrific policies of the chinese government. instead we reward them. our trade deficit in the first three months of this year was more than $50 billion. last year it was a quarter trillion dollars. china manipulates its currency. most economists agree that the chinese wuan is 30% under value.that manipulation is a coerced and false price reduction. it puts our manufacturers at a disadvantage. but there's so much money to be made by u.s. investors that investors and large corporate interests and our government simply look the other way. china profits from its abysmal human rights record. it profits from its -- it profits from its nearly   nonexistent environmental standards. but american investors, the american government, american business look the other way. china refuses to enforce its labor laws, but there's money to be made, so american investors, american corporations and the american government look the other way. china benefits from its human rights abuses. but, again, american investors, american corporations and the american government look the other way. even before, mr. president, this current recession, the u.s. manufacturing sector has been incrisis. 40,000 american factories closed in the past decade. since 2000, the u.s. has lost more than 4 million manufacturing jobs, many in the presiding officer's home state of colorado. 200,000 manufacturing jobs in ohio. 2008 study by the economic policy institute found the u.s. has lost more than 2.3 million jobs since 2001. as a direct   result of the u.s. trade deficit with china. we shouldn't let china profit from recession. it is not just the chinese pushing for the status quo. those who -- these are american investors, american companies actively support a regime that is trying to become a global competitor. no no boundaries, too often these companies leave their moral come pass at home. -- compass at home.the united states should stand up to rather than apologize for china's brutal regime. if china seeks to become a member of the international community, it should match its aspirations. china continued to deny its people basic freedoms of speech and religion and assembly. it increased severe cultural and religious oppression of ethnic minorities such as the uighurs.   it increased persecution of chinese christians and increased suppression of dissidents and journalists. earlier today i had the pleasure of meeting, again, my -- someone i worked with 10 years ago. he is about 60 now has been called the father of chinese democracy. he spent 18 years in prison. he spent 18 years in prison forbringing democracy to his country he was jailed because his government accused him of conspiring against it by writing about knock siment since his release from prison the second time, he was exiled to canada. he has been a force for exactic change for his nation founding the chinese democracy coalition. he has been nominated for the nobel peace prize seven different times. he lives in washington, the   capital of our democracy, but he continues to fight for democracy in his home country. the chinese people, like americans, trying to live meaningful, peaceful lives an create a better world for their children. unfortunately they're held hostage by a brutal, one party communist totalitarianism regime. they benefit from lax trade enforcement to the lax response to blatant human rights abuses,the u.s. by its acquiescence propped up the chinese communist country. the united states partner is u.s. -- large u.s. corporations. as we walked the halls of the house of representatives in 1999 during the discussion and debate on the permanent normal trade relations with china, he told me that the vanguard of the communist party revolution in the united states, the vanguard   of the chinese party revolution of the united states of america is american c.e.o.'s. it was the american c.e.o.'s who walked the halls of congress in 1989, our presiding officer remembers this, who walked the halls of congress in 1989, lobbying on behalf of the communist party chinese dictatorship to get trade advantages to america. it was the c.e.o.'s of america's corporations that walked from office to office in the senate and the house of representativesbegging members of the house and senate to vote to give trade advantages to this communist party dictatorship, this dictatorship that oppresses its people, that -- that -- that inflicted violence on those people in 1989, it has ever since. it was american c.e.o.'s that lobbied for trade advantages for china so that china in the end would take millions of jobs from the united states of america from galion, ohio and akron,   ohio, and junctiontown, ohio, dayton -- youngstown, ohio, because c.e.o.'s lobbied congress down the hall to give trade advantages to the communist party dictatorship in china. we have paid a price. the chinese people paid an even more important price. i'm proud to join with senator inhofe to introduce with him a resolution acknowledging therevolution of the tianamen crackdown. it demands that china release its political and religious prisoners. today, mr. president, we look back on the tianamen protest, we honor those who died in the struggle for freedom. let's remember that brave, unnamed protester who 20 years ago believed that one person can change the world through peace an nonviolence. think what a whole nation can   do, mr. president. thank you. the presiding officer: the clerk will call the roll. quorum call:the presiding officer: the senator from north carolina. a senator: mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to vitiate the quorum call. the presiding officer: without objection, so ordered. mr. burr: mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to be recognized for up to 30 minutes. the presiding officer: is there objection? without objection, so ordered. mr. burr: thank you, mr. president. when i yielded the floor toallow senator brown to speak, i was in the process of describing the substitute amendment to the base bill, h.r. 1256. before i go back to that, let me share for my colleagues the response to a letter from the campaign for tobacco-free kids. they assess the substitute bill, and they provided in a letter to   the committee why they found the substitute to be wrong. i use that word. let me take on some of the things they raised in that letter. one, they said that the burr-hagan bill would create a new bureaucracy that lacks the experience, expertise, and resources to effectively regulate tobacco products. i think i made it abundantlyclear earlier today that under the current regulatory framework for tobacco every federal agency in the united states has jurisdiction in it except for the food and drug administration. so to suggest that the food and drug administration has the experience or the expertise or the resources to effectively regulate this would just be disingenuous. they have no experience because they haven't been involved in regulation. they do have expertise, but   expertise to prove safety and efficacy of products, not to come to the conclusion that a product is unsafe and kills, yet, they're not going to do anything to restrict its access. and resources to effectively regulate tobacco products. incorporated in this base bill, 1256, is, in fact, a surcharge on the tobacco industry o of $700 million over the firstthree years to fund -- to provide the resources for the f.d.a. to regulate the industry. and it doesn't stop there. because they can't hire the folks, they can't set up the regulation until they've got the ability to do the surcharge it requires in putting it in the f.d.a. that you come up with $200 million to fund the initial effort to set up the   infrastructure to regulate this product. so, in fact, there were no resources. within 1256 it reyates the resources to create the framework to create the personnel to regulate the product that have never regulated the product before. i remind you in the substitute amendment we set up a new harm reduction center under the guidelines of the secretary of health and human services,within the health and human services, the same place that the f.d.a. is. and when we asked the secretary of h.h.s. how much does it take to fund that? they gave us a number of $100 million a year. $700 million for the base bill, 1256, $100 million for this new center of harm reduction. overseen by the same secretary of health and human services.   now, granted, i'll be the first to say if we're creating a new agency, the agency for harm reduction, it has not got the experience or expertise or the resources yet of the but it can search within the global marketplace to find the individuals and the secretary of h.h.s. said that $100 million will allow that. so the first complaint, hopefully i disposed of that.second complaint for the campaign for tobacco-free kids for why they will not support the amendment. the burr-hagan bill does not give meaningful authority to change tobacco products. well, mr. president, i do hope somebody from campaign-free kids is watching. because what the base bill, h.r. 1256, does is it locks in these   products, nonfiltered and filtered cigarettes, and legislatively says to the f.d.a., you can't do anything with those products. they are grand fathered. -- grandfathered. and, as you heard me say, 1256 does not allow these reduced-risk products to come to market. to the tobacco industry based upon how the legislation is written would basically limit tobacco usage to these twocategories, the 100% risky and the 95% risky. i misspoke, and let me correct it. because within h.r. 1256 it does state any product sold prior to february 2007 could, in fact, be sold. some, not all, u.s. smokeless products fall into that category of having been sold prior to february of 2007. one has to ask, why   february 2007? why was that manning dismal it's very simple. that's the last time they -- why is that magical? it's very simple. that's the last time they updated this bill. i'm sure that they updated before 2009, but they weren't careful enough to have the effective date to cut off when the product is sold. there is nothing magical to february of 2007 except that u.s. smokeless products were included.","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 4,

about the challenges people face in the work force today.   the chair: the gentleman is recognized. >> madam speaker, some of the greatest joys of my life for the births of my daughter and son, two years ago my daughter madison was able to be there for the birth with my wife, one of the great joys of my life, and then four weeks ago tomorrow, the birth of my baby boy harrison and i was there as well, just wonderful, wonderful times that every family should spend together.those opportunities already exist today in law. there's nothing in this bill that either takes away or gives the ability for parents to do that. they already have that right today. as they all should. why i rise in objection to this bill is it adds an extra $938 million in new entitlements, in new debt, money that we don't have in this country to an already growing deficit, we're at a $1.9 trillion deficit this   year alone, projections are that in the next five year, administration will double the national debt and at what time do we stop and look out for those children? my son that was born four weeks ago. when do we look out for his future and his opportunity? so that he doesn't have to inherit another billion dollars in debt that this bill will give him? i think it's ironic in the same week that general motors becamegovernment motors, because of primarily health benefits, benefits added on and added on for employees to the point where the benefits of the employees bankrupted the company. what's congress' answer to that? congress' answer in the same week is to add more benefits at a time when people are losing their jobs, money that we don't have, almost $1 billion, you know, there used to be a saying, a billion here a   billion there, pretty soon you're talking about real money. i think the public across this country has spoken out, they've said, enough is enough. we've got to control spending and look out for future generations. i yield back. . mr. lynch: the way this has been scored by c.b.o. its that the salaries paid to the employees already, the costs and/orsavings, recognizing the c.b.o. estimate that has been cited here that by forcing federal employees to take leave without pay, they realize a savings from that, but there's no new debt acquired here. what the savings here that c.b.o. is recognizing is is the fact that they have budgeted for these salaries and people take a   certain amount of time off without pay and that realizes a gain in the budget that is recognized in the c.b.o. budget. i yield two minutes to the the gentleman from virginia, mr. moran. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. moran: i thank my very good friend from massachusetts, mr. lynch, and mrs. maloney and my colleagues who have fought hard for this bill. a couple of reasons why i am a proud co-sponsor of thislegislation. one is that we are in the midst of an economic crisis in this nation. and who do we turn to? we turn to the federal work force to reset our economy, to put our nation's investments where they need to be. we turn to them because we know that they are incorruptible. this is the most professional, least corruptible organization,   civil service in the world. we should be very proud of our civil servants. now as the cor cor corporate bo directors ofas the corporate bo directors of the largest work force in the nation, it's incumbent of us to let them know how we see them, to recognize them, to incentivize them, to recruit the very best andbrightest people in this nation and to retain them. and how do we do that? by leading in terms of the benefits that other large corporations provide. we should be leading by example. but the reality is that other large work forces oftentimes provide better benefits than the federal government. we need to be in the leadership. this enables us to catch up. we recognize these employees by doing things that are tangible.   and this is a tangible benefit. second reason is that we recognize that the most important time in anyone's life are those first few weeks after birth, where a parent has the opportunity to nurture, where the child can bond, where the child's brain can be stimulated and the child can understand they will grow up in a secure and safe environment.i very much thank my good friend. and i would hope that those who are in kind of knee-jerk opposition to this legislation would reconsider because mr. wolf perhaps expressed it best, these are the days that matter, the weeks that matter. we want the healthiest work force, we want the strongest society possible. and if we are to do that, when   we are the corporate board of directors of the largest work force, we should lead by example by providing paid parental leave so a child can bond with their parents, get them off to a healthy start. that's what this is all about, a strong society, enabling every child born in america the full opportunity to realize their potential. this legislation enables the federal work force to achievethat objective. it's a noble, national objective and what america ought to be about. let's get this legislation passed. the chair: the gentleman from california. mr. issa: how much time is remaining on each side? the chair: the gentleman from california has 6 1/4 and the gentleman from massachusetts has seven minutes remaining.   mr. issa: i reserve. the chair: the gentleman from massachusetts. the gentleman from california re served. mr. lynch: we continue to reserve. mr. issa: is the gentleman prepared to close? the chair: the gentleman from california has 6 1/4 and the gentleman from massachusetts has seven minutes remaining. mr. lynch: i believe we have people on our list but haven't come, so i'm prepared to close. mr. issa: i'm prepared to closeand i yield myself such time as i may consume. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. issa: in a few short minutes, we will complete general debate and go to amendments. at that time, i'm hopeful that the amendments offered by the committee, republicans on this committee, will be considered favorably. if it is, then what seems to be unreconcileable as our   differences can be resolved. 14 million americans are out of work. we agree we are in a recession. we agree that americans are suffering. we agree that whether you're having a child, adopting a child or bringing a foster child in need into your home, that that bonding time is worth while, now, just as it was in 1993 when we overroad all states and all employers to provide that option without fear of retaliation or loss of a job. i think we agree that this billis 12 weeks, eight of which may be paid by use of sick and other leave. i know we agreed that if you served 15 years in the government, you'll have about eight weeks a year of paid leave. already accrued. we only disagree on whether or not a new cost, a new entitlement will be borne by the american people. we seem to disagree on whether going from not paying somebody   off is a cost of the government. we disagree on whether or not when it becomes an additional four weeks of pay, many will choose to take it. when the c.b.o. scored, they made the assumption that half of all men would not take any benefits under the parental leave act, as they currently don't. when you offer four weeks free, it will be irresist tabble.so there are some things we disagree on. if we take what we agree on, which is the american people are watching mounting deficits. the american people do believe that at times we are out of touch and we don't feel their pain. the gentleman from virginia talked about the federal workers in his district. the federal workers have grown in his district during a time during which the gentleman from illinois has seen 40,000 workers lose their jobs at caterpillar.   they may have had benefits, today they have no benefits. they're not choosing between having a paycheck or being with their child. they're choosing whether or not to go out and find some minimum wage job or do something to try and bring money into the house, because they no longer have the good paying jobs that have evaporated in this recession. we disagreed in how the stimuluspackage was done but we needed to get americans rolling again and give them the opportunities. what the 14 million have given up and more have given up in loss of some of their income is what we disagree about. madam chair, i would ask unanimous consent that the c.b.o. score -- c.b.o. document scoring this be placed into the record so there is no disagreement. the letter opposing this be placed into the record and   letter from the independent electrical contractors be placed into the record at this time. the chair: the request has to be made at the time the house is in the full house. mr. issa: lastly, madam chair, i believe that the intentions of the majority are generally good. but i believe that this bill contains something the americanpeople may not have heard. and in closing, i want them to hear. this bill not only gives four weeks of new paid leave for the mom who may be coming home immediately following the birth of a child, but it gives that four weeks of additional pay to the father. it does so whether it's an adult child they're adopting, someone 15, 16 going off to school every day. it does it for both mom and dad and does it on top of the eight   weeks they can take in other ways already. i want the american people to understand not only does it do that, but it is anticipated by the majority that after an o.m.b. study which they fully believe will show on balance this is a good motivator, this benefit will rise from four weeks of additional pay to eight weeks of additional pay for both men and women in the federal work force at a time when 14 million americans have no income at all.with that, madam chair, i hope that the majority will see that they're out of touch if they don't think the american people are concerned that this is, in fact, showing a disconnect between the american people suffering and, in fact, the new benefits to the one portion of the work force that is not suffering, the one portion that is -- has not seen a pay cut, but a pay raise, the one portion that has not seen cuts in their numbers, but increases in their numbers, and that's the wonderful men and women who make   up the federal work force in all areas. they're good people, but they in listening tonight, i believe the federal workers in my district will understand that, in fact, this is a time for them not to look for a big gain, when in fact, people are losing their homes. i would urge that we not support the bill in the current form. and i look forward to the amendment we plan to offer being favorably considered so we can make a bill that balances this good effort with those 14million people who today have no solution for parental leave and, in fact, do not understand why we would add four or eight weeks paid additional time no matter how well intentioned. with that, i yield back. the chair: the gentleman yields back the balance of his time. the gentleman from massachusetts. mr. lynch: thank you, madam speaker. this bill is narrowly tailored.   it would provide four weeks paid of parental leave. the specific instances are the birth of a new child, an adoption or someone taking a child into foster care. that's how you qualify for receiving this four weeks of benefits. and i think that this makes a strategic investment in the federal work force. this will help the governmentretain and attract young talented young employees and in so doing, it provides potentially for ultimate savings to the american people because there is a benefit when the government retains existing employees rather than to rehire and train new ones. we are aware of the revolving door in the federal government where we bring in people, we train them, they become competent in their area of   expertise and then private industry steals them away because they can offer them much gaiter benefits and much, much higher pay. this provides a basic and decent benefit of four weeks in the occasions that i mentioned. before closing, i would like to also point out that the obama administration in their recently issued statement of administration policy on h.r. 626 also recognized the benefits of supporting families duringthe birth of a child or adoption of a child or in foster care. according to the president's policy position, the federal government should reflect its commitment to helping federal employees care for their families as well as serve the public. and measures such as h.r. 626 support this commitment and strengthens our families, communities and our nation. given that statement alone, i urge my fellow members to join   me in voting in favor of h.r. 626. and i yield back the balance the time. the chair: the the gentleman yields back the balance of his time. all time for general debate has expired. the bill shall be considered read for amendment under the five-minute rule. no amendment to the bill is in order except those printed in house report 111-133. only one amendment may be permitted by a member, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally dividedand controlled by the proponent and opponent of the amendment, shall not be subject to amendment or demand to division of the question. it is now in order to consider amendment number one printed in house report 1111-133. for what purpose does the gentleman from california rise? mr. issa: i have an amendment made in order under the rule. the chair: the clerk will designate the amendment. the clerk: amendment number one printed in house report 111-133   offered by mr. issa of california. the chair: pursuant to house resolution 501, the gentleman from california, mr. issa and a member opposed will each control five minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. . mr. issa: i yield myself such time as i may consume. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. issa: i believe the legislation bridges the difference between the majority and minority, recognizing thatthe federal work force should in fact be able to use a crude and -- accrued and earned time they have, recognizing it is already the policy of many, but not all, federal agencies to allow all accrued leave, both vacation, you will, and sick leave, to be used by somebody wishing to avail themselves of their 12 weeks of family medical leave. having said that, we do take away the question of four weeks   of additional paid or eight weeks of additional paid leave. we recognize, though that not every person, particularly a young family, new to the federal work force, may have accrued leave sufficient to do 12 full weeks. therefore, my amendment allows for that worker to take an advance against future sick leave and other leaves in order to ensure they may remain with their new child for the full 12 weeks allotted, allowed withinthe law. this would in fact eliminate the contradiction between various government agencies. it would streamline the process and make clear that no federal worker would ever have to choose between being with their newborn and receiving a paycheck. so with that, i urge the strong support of this amendment as a common sense middle ground and reserve the balance of my time. the chair: for what purpose does the gentleman from massachusetts rise? mr. lynch: madam chair, i'd   like to yield myself -- the chair: the gentleman -- does the gentleman rise in opposition? mr. lynch: i rise in opposition to the amendment. cho the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. lynch: i yield myself such time as i may consume. ky not support the amendment at hand as it goes against the bill's fundamental purpose. to begin this amendment actually guts the bill, it does little more than restate the status quo with regard to the type and amount of leave currently available to newparents in the federal government. to be clear, i support h.r. 626 because i want to support working families across the country. i oppose the amendment because we should not replicate the current inadequate system that forces moms and dads to choose between their paychecks and caring for a newborn. the gentleman's amendment would strike the bill's core requirement that federal employees receive four weeks of   paid leave. instead, it would require them to take advance leave in order to take care of their newborn or newly adopted child. in other words, new employees would be required to go into debt in their available -- in their available leave as a cost of caring for their child. i do want to point out an odd result of the gentleman's amendment. for the new employees who have unpaid leave right now, it would force them to take unpaidleave at a point in time, for instance, for a new mom, right after she has the baby. it would force her to take unpaid leave. and then later on, after the eight or 12 weeks have been expired, at a point maybe when that mom was ready to come back to work, it would then give those employees, mom and dad, four weeks of paid leave. and so rather than come back to work, they'd be facing the   opportunity to take paid leave at that point. i think in some cases, it may turn out that this may increase the cost, while it actually devalues the benefit to the employee up front, it also by perhaps getting a higher utilization rate in the end may cost the government more money. so it's sort of a lose-lose situation. longer term employees would be required to exhaust any available prior leave beforebeing eligible to take the additional advance leave and under most circumstances, they may already do this. so the amendment's only alleged new benefit to employees is to allow newer hires to go into a deficit on their leave in order to get days paid in their parental leave. again, federal agencies can already offer advance leave so there's no new benefit here. the true effect of this benefit is to gut the primary purpose of the bill to support families   and child development by providing four weeks of unconditional paid leave to new mothers and fathers in the federal work force. in addition to gutting the bill, the amendment is inequitable because it would impact new employees and older employees differently. plfer, the amendment is not good policy because employees should not be forced to use uh up their accrued annual sick leave to care for a new child this can leave employees in a desperate situation if anyemergency arises or if they become seriously ill down the road. this amendment is somewhat shortsighted, it ignores the strategic invest thament h.r. 626 makes in the federal work force at a time we need to be attracted young, talented employees to prepare far wave of upcoming retirements. currently we have about 315,000 federal employees that are eligible to retire. unfortunately, those are the most experienced and in some   cases the most ablest employees we have in the federal government. so this bill -- this amendment ignores the social benefits to society as a whole that result from supporting families with progressive work life policy such as a paid parental leave program. because it guts the pending legislation, i have to oppose it for all the reasons i have stated, in spite of the gentleman's good intentions and i ask that members continue to support the bill and opposethis amendment. i reserve the balance of our time. the chair: the gentleman reserves. the gentleman from california. mr. issa: i now proudly yield one minute to the ranking member of the subcommittee and somebody who is very aware of family values and the importance of this legislation, mr. chaffetz of utah. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. chaffetz: there's no more precious time than those with   your children. we want to be as compassionate as we can. but at a time when we have millions and millions of people out of work and are looking at a $1.8 trillion budget deficit just this year alone, i don't want to straddle that new kid, that new child who is coming into the world with this unbelievable debt. so it's something i'd like to do, but i think what mr. issa's amendment offers is a very reasonable alternative to create the atmosphere andcreate the program and create the way our federal employees can tap into something they have earned, but i think we have an obligation to recognize the proper role of government. we have to remember, for every dollar, every benefit that we want to hand to a federal worker, we're going to have to take that money from somewhere and we're going to have to take it from the american people's pockets to give to it someone else. when we recognize that balance we recognize that somebody is   going to have to pay for that -- mr. issa: i yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. chaffetz: i appreciate what mr. issa is proposing. let's remember it's the american people's money, not congress' money. it's the american people's money. at a time of hurt a time of deficit, now is not the time to go out and spend billions more dollars when we're so far in debt. i thank mr. issa and yield back the balance of my timethe chair: the gentleman yields back. mr. lynch: i continue to reserve. the chair: the gentleman from california. mr. issa: i believe i have the right to close. the chair: that's not correct, the gentleman from massachusetts has the right to close. mr. issa: then i reserve. the chair: the gentleman from california has two minutes remaining, the gentleman from massachusetts has 30 seconds remaining. the -- who seeks time?   is the gentleman from massachusetts -- mr. lynch: i continue to reserve. the chair: is the gentleman from massachusetts prepared to close? mr. lynch: yes. the chair: the gentleman from california. mr. issa: i want to review one more time why we believe that doing this within the existing means of the program dollars already available to thefederal work force is a common sense compromise. meeting the majority halfway but recognizing that 14 million americans making no money except for their unemployment insurance and those who are making so much less this year demand that we find ways not to increase our spending. so madam chair, i would like to review one last time, the federal work force, if you have been only three years, you have four weeks of paid vacation and 13 days which is nearly three   weeks, of sick leave per year. you already have that every year. isn't it family values to be willing to give up some of that to be able to stay with your family? why wouldn't you use some of that first? madam chair, i want to recognize that the work force, the federal work force is a good workforce. we want it to be a great workforce. but at a time when 14 million americans are looking for jobs, we are not having a hard timefinding people who want to come to work for the federal government. we're offering jobs, we're hiring, we're growing. if we're ever going to need an inducement, it'll be at a boom time when we have to compete against higher salaries and bonuses, not at a time when americans are being laid off and suffering in record numbers. lastly, madam chair, i would like to refer to the president's statement in support of the bill he redelites bill.   he says the administration is currently reviewing existing federal leave policies to determine the extent of the gaps and limitations. the administration looks forward to working with congress to refine the details of this legislation to make sure it meets the needs of the federal agencies and employees as well as their families masm dam chair, what that says to me is, this is not the right bill. they'd like to work with us to make it better. hopefully this amendment will make it better here today. i yield back. the chair: the gentleman from massachusetts. mr. lynch: i'd like to yieldfor the purpose of closing to the individual, along with congressman hoyer, mrs. maloney has championed the bill for the past 15 years. i yield her the remaining time in order to close. the chair: the gentlelady is recognized for 30 seconds. mrs. maloney: may i inquire how much time i have? the chair: 30 seconds. mrs. maloney: i appreciate my colleague's hard work and effort but i rise in opposition to the amendment. the amendment would do absolutely nothing but maintain the status quo. it asks federal employees to   continue to cobble together sick and annual leave if they want to get a paycheck while they care for their new child. this policy does not help relatively new employees, younger workers, or those with health problems who have little accrued leave to draw on. it also puts the health and well being of our employees and their families at risk. a new baby typically -- the chair: the gentlelady's time has expired. mrs. maloney: i would request an opportunity to place in the","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN : June 4, 2009 6:30pm-7:00pm

as a kid. he started smoking as a little boy. same with my mother. same with my brothers.   one brother started when he was in the air force. he was -- i guess 20 years old or something like that. he wasn't very old. all of my other family members started smoking as kids. one of my brothers chewed tobacco. i can remember i had a friend that learned that my brother had chewed tobacco. he was a lobbyist for the tobacco industry, and he said, i'll send him a case of -- whatkind does he chew? i didn't think that was a good idea. so, you know, i -- i met in los angeles last week the first lawyer that filed a litigation -- serious litigation against the tobacco industry, a wonderful man. he got terribly upset with the joe camel advertisements when they placed those little -- that little comic strip character on   lunch boxes for kids. and he also was upset at that time that the tobacco industry went through another one of their ideas to get kids to start smoking in stores like a 7/eleven store, they would have bins of cigarettes out there. you're supposed to pay for them. but they were there. kids could steal them so easy. and so he filed this lawsuit. he had the confidence to tell mehe lost that lawsuit. but when all of the lawyers got together to go after the tobacco companies big time, they -- they pooled their money and went after the tobacco companies, they used all of his pleadings. he said even the misspelled words they used. they didn't change anything. ultimately that led to the favorable ruling by the courts   that the tobacco company's reliable for the damages and the billions of dollars. so it's important that we move forward on this. i would hope that cloture would be invoked on this monday afternoon. it's one of the most popular piece of legislations we could do. and i'm sorry we weren't able to work anything out on the amendments, but we simply were not able to do so. no one can complain, this entire congress, that we haven't had the ability to offer amendments.we were concerned for a lot of reasons. one is that we have the supplemental appropriation bill -- appropriation bill floating around here and we didn't want a lot of nongermane amendments on this. but there were no restrictions on even nongermane amendments. the republicans wanted to look at ours, we wanted to look at theirs. we used to do that a lot, we can still do that. but no one can complain and use as an excuse not to vote for this bill that we haven't been willing to offer amendments on   this side. so i hope that senators will take a look at this and move forward, let us invoke cloture on this, complete this legislation. i have already indicated i would be happy to work out something that would be fair and reasonable to dispose of the amendments that are germane to this bill that have been filed. a senator: madam president? the senator from connecticut. emr. dodd: i want to begin by thanking the majority leader for his efforts and for those ofothers. we're prepared to debate the germane amendments, or the amendments that are arguably ger pain it is regrettable we couldn't do that. this bill has enjoyed overwhelming support in the previous congresses that have been raised in both chambers. and as i pointed out that every single day that we fail to act on this legislation, the statistics are that 3,000 to 4,000 children begin to smoke every day.   400,000 of our fellow citizens will die each year. and thousands more will live very debilitating lives as a result of being contaminated by cigarette smoke and tobacco products. we're on the eve of a national health care debate where the major part of that will be prevention. what better way to begin that debate than the congress taking a step in this area that will make a difference. i thank the majority leader for his efforts. i'm still hopeful that we can get this done. i believe we can. people like senator burr,senator hagan who have legitimate interests and concerns about the legislation before us deserve to have their amendment considered and discussed. it is regrettable that one single member of this body on a nongermane proposal can cause us to delay or avoid meeting the obligation of the issues and concerns about tobacco and their effect on our citizenry. i thank the majority leader for his efforts. be here next week to be prepared to debate those amendments and   hopefully our colleagues will invoke cloture to get this matter addressed. mr. reid: while the distinguished senator is on the floor, senator enzi has been a real partner in what we've done here. he asked that we do a committee hearing on this bill. we could have brought it to the floor, this bill has had lots of hearings in the past. but because mike enzi is such agentleman, and he thought it would be the right thing to do, we went ahead in spite of the very difficult schedule that we have, and the schedule that especially senator dodd had, that all of the things that we were doing under the jurisdiction of the banking committee, senator kennedy was the one obligated to do this legislation, so we have done that. we jumped -- see wee have jumped through all of the hoops. i hope that no one will in   voting cloture say that we have been unfair. it would be unfair to say that we have been unfair. madam president, i would ask that we now terminate morning business and have the bill reported. the presiding officer: morning business is closed. under the previous order the senate will consider h.r. 1256 which the the clerk will report. the clerk: h.r. 1256, an act it protect the public health by providing the food and drug administration with certain authority to regulate tobacco products and for other purposes.mr. reid: madam president? i send a cloture motion on the dodd substitute amendment to the desk. the presiding officer: the clerk will report. the clerk: cloture motion: we, the undersigned senators, in accordance with the provisions   of rule 22 of the standing rules of the senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on dodd substitute amendment number 1247, to calendar number 47, h.r. 1256, family smoking prevention family act. mr. reid: i ask consent that the reading of the names be waived. the presiding officer: without objection. mr. reid: i now, madam president, send a cloture petition to the desk. and this is on the bill itself. the presiding officer: the clerk will report. the clerk: cloture motion:we, the undersigned senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule 22 of the standing rules of the senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on calendar number 47, h.r. 125, family smoking prevention and tobacco control act signed by 17 senators as follows: reid, dodd -- mr. reid: madam president, i would ask the reading of the names be dispensed with. the presiding officer: without objection. mr. reid: i ask the mandatory quorum under rule 22 be waived. the presiding officer: without   objection. mr. reid: i ask that we go into a period of morning business with senators allowed to speak therein up to 10 minutes each. the presiding officer: without objection. mr. reid: we just went -- i would like to go into morning business. the presiding officer: the senator from arizona. mr. mccain: i have an amendment that i've been trying to get a vote on. i would say to the distinguished majority leader and it certainly is important to the","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 4, 2009 5:00pm-5:30pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

ms. bordallo: mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the clerk: amendment number 11, printed in house report 111-127offered by mrs. bordallo of guam. the chair: pursuant to house resolution 474, the gentlewoman from guam and a member opposed each will control 20 minutes. the gentlewoman is recognized. ms. bordallo: i thank congressman thompson and congresswoman jackson lee for their support of this amendment. my amendment is simple and straightforward. it would require the assistant secretary of t.s.a. to conduct a   study and make recommendations on specific methods by which airports in the u.s. territories, including the guam international airport in my district, can best and most cost effectively comply with existing security regulations, specifically, it asks t.s.a. to review compliance with part 1544 and 1546 of title 49 of the federal regulations relating to the issue of co-mingling ofpassengers at u.s. airports. it would evaluate alternatives and identify the costs for their impleatation. it is to identify sources of federal and nonfederal financing to determine the preferred alternative. guam is a small hub, mr. chairman, for a domestic airline. our airport on guam facilitates the daily transiting of international passengers to destinations in the united   states, other pacific islands, major cities in the pacific rim, including, japan, korea, taiwan and australia. the security arrangement requires significant resources to be expended in constant around the clock monitoring by security personnel to prevent the co-mingling of transiting and departing passengers. the security enhancements made subsequent to the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, particularly with respect topreventing the co-mingling of passengers at our airports all across the country have been costly and in some cases difficult to fully implement. moreover, the current decrease in tourist arrivals and departures due to the economic downturn erodes the financial capability of small airports to implement such security improvements. the guam international airport authority has been operating from a waiver from the t.s.a. for several years.   the t.s.a. and the guam international airport agree that the temporary solution which amounts to placement of removable par tissue ons and use of security staff to prevent co-mingling of passengers in their movements throughout the terminal is not feasible for the long-term. however, the cost of implementing security arrangements and improvements at the guam airport to ensure compliance is costly and since other security enhancements and expansion of the airport havecompletely obligated the passenger facility charge. the amendment before us, mr. chairman, simply looks to provide options for solving this problem on guam and potentially, as well as other airports in the u.s. territories. more importantly, it would provide guidance for funding and implea mentation of these improvements. i thank the chairman and his committee staff for his work with me and for the record, i   urge passage of the next amendment, number two, sponsored by congressman jackson lee and congressman hastings and i yield back. the chair: the gentlewoman from guam reserves the balance of her time? ms. bordallo: i yield back. the chair: for what purpose does the gentleman from pennsylvania rise? mr. dent: i rise to claim opposition to the amendment, although i have no real objection.the chair: without objection, jarred for five minutes. mr. dent: i would like to say i support the amendment. guam international airport does not serve passengers traveling internationally from those passengers traveling domestically. there is no separation either by a separate floor or wall. prior to 9/11, the co-mingling of domestic international travelers was not a concern. guam international is concerned about the security implications of the current system and looking for a long term solution   to prevent co-mingling of international passengers. this amendment would require that the t.s.a. review the current procedures in place at the airports of the u.s. territories and make recommendations to the airports and how best to address the co-mingling of passengers. i yield at this time to the chair of the committee on transportation and infrastructure protection, congresswoman jackson lee. ms. jackson lee: i would like toapplaud the gentlelady from guam for this foughtful amendment. mr. speaker, if we are going to have homeland security, we must have expanded homeland security and that includes our territories. this amendment directs t.s.a. to identify in its report funding sources to recover the costs of any long-term security improvements that would be needed at these airports in the territories. i believe this is crucial. this is a seamless and important part of homeland security. and i would ask my colleagues to   support it, which includes u.s. territories, especially the guam international airport, which is subject to significant fluctuations in passenger volume pause of the passenger volume. this is a good amendment and i ask my colleagues to support it. the chair: the gentlewoman yields back. the gentleman from pennsylvania. mr. dent: i yield back. the chair: the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlelady from guam. those in favor say aye. those opposed, no. in the opinion ofthe chair, the ayes have it and the amendment is agreed to. it is now in order to consider amendment number 12 printed in house report 111-127. for what purpose does the gentleman from washington rise? mr. hastings: i have an amendment at the desk. the clerk: amendment number 12 printed in house report 111-127 offered by mr. hastings of washington. the chair: pursuant to house resolution 474, the gentleman from washington, mr. hastings, and a member opposed each will control five minutes. the chair recognizes the   gentleman from washington. mr. hastings: i thank my colleagues, ms. jackson lee of texas and mr. rogers for co-sponsoring this very important amendment. highly trained canine teams have been trained in the united states since 1973. dogs are extremely reliable in their mobility and makes them invaluable in screening all types of cargo quickly and effectively. as we approach the august, 2010 deadline to screen cargotransported on passenger airlines, it is critical that t.s.a. is prepared to deal with all types of cargo without unnecessarily slowing down. within my district, cherry growers transport half of the cherries they export on passenger airlines. my amendment would increase the number of canine teams specifically dedicated to air cargo by a minimum of 100 dogs. the need for additional canines   is clear. the seattle-tacoma airport began screening all of its air cargo earlier this year. in order to meet the needs, t.s.a. will bring canine teams to the pacific northwest and other parts of the country during the cherry harvest to ensure all cherries are screened this a timely manner. once the 100% requirement goes into effect next year, the burden on all these canine teams will only increase. at a time when our economy isstruggling, we should not be adding new rod blocks for american farmers and businesses. i strongly urge my colleagues to support, keeping our skies secure without interrupting commerce and voting yes on the hastings-jack son lee-rogers amendment. i reserve.   the chair: for what purpose does the gentlewoman from from texas. ms. jackson lee: i rise in opposition to the amendment although i do not oppose the amendment. the chair: the gentlelady is recognized for five minutes. ms. jackson lee: i thank the full committee chairman and mr. dent. it was a pleasure to work with mr. hastings and mr. rogers. iize in support of the hastings-rogers-jackson lee amendment. i appreciate their willingness to work with me on this important amendment. we have towered the homelandsecurity sites that have had canines and heard from airports who say give me one good dog and we provide security. t.s.a.'s canine teams are important and effective tools for securing all modes of transportation in the united states. the use of canine teams has managed what few security measures can boast. they are well liked. our committee worked hard to re-affirm our support for canine teams in explosion detection.   i'm proud to have led these efforts. this amendment rounds out these important provisions as we speak, t.s.a. continues its work meeting the 100% cargo screening requirement established by the 9/11 act. let me indicate that i'm very proud of the language we have about 100% cargo screening. it is one that we worked with the department of homeland security. we worked with mr. markey. we worked with our chairman and our ranking member of both committees, the subcommittee andfull committee. we want 100% screening. the canine teams that will be deployed will ensure t.s.a.'s success. mr. hastings, mr. rogers and i have offered what i perceive to be a thoughtful amendment. and i urge my colleagues to support it. i thank mr. hastings and mr. rogers for their collaboration. with that, i'm going to yield become. the chair: the gentlewoman from texas yields back. the gentleman from washington. mr. hastings: i yield myself the balance of the time.   i thank my colleague for her thoughtful remarks and working with us. agri business is big and the cherry season is in a tight time frame and it is important that nothing slows down the process of getting these cherries to market. i thank my friend from guam for endorsing this amendment. i urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment. the chair: the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from washington. those in favor say aye. those opposed, no. in the opinion the e of the chair, the ayes have itand the amendment is agreed to. it is now in order to consider amendment number 13 printed in house report 111-127. for what purpose does the gentleman from north carolina rise? butt combut i have an amendment at the desk. the clerk: amendment number 13 printed in house report 111-127 offered by mr. butterfield of north carolina. the chair: pursuant to house resolution 474, the gentleman from north carolina, mr. butterfield, and a member opposed each will control five minutes.   the chair recognizes the gentleman from north carolina. mr. butterfield: i rise in support in support of the underlying bill, the transportation security administration authorization act of 2009. this is a necessary bill that will help to safeguard the american people. and i want to commend my friend and colleague, chairman thompson from mississippi, for steering this legislation through this process. your leadership does not go unnoticed by members of this body and the american people andwe thank you. we thank the ranking member of this committee, mr. king of new york, for his leadership and for his work on homeland security as well as the other members of the committee. i particularly want to thank the hard working staff of the homeland security committee for all that they do and the work they have done in getting this legislation to the floor today. mr. chairman, i offer a very simple amendment to h.r. 2200. it authorizes a study on the feasibility of combining facial and iris technologies for rapid   identification in airport security checkpoint lines. the study would focus on merits of using the combined technologies and the potential for use. researchers tell us that this new technology holds great promise for providing highly reliable, efficient, unobstructtive and accurate way to establish and identify identities. unlike names and dates of birthwhich can be changed from time to time. byo metrics are impossible to duplicate. it is being collected by the department of homeland security through its u.s. visit program. this invaluable information helps prevent people from using fraudulent documents to attempt to enter our country illegally. collecting this information protects travelers' identities in the event travel documents   are lost or stolen. one of my constituents had his passport stolen and has been unable to travel in more than one year. this technology would have made the issueance of travel documents a less cumbersome process. utilizing advance technologies like special cameras or imaging systems of did-d and 3-d facialtechnology, they could analyze the data in a few short seconds. the collection analysis and identification of an individual, mr. chairman, would only take as much as it takes a person to go through that dreaded security line at the airport. in fact, the security would be sped up and significantly lessen the time an individual spends in time. by combining the facial and iris recognition data, t.s.a. officials would get an accurate   identification of an individual an would have the opportunity to investigate further if necessary. effective use of these databases to confirm or discover personal identities is critical in maintaining our national security. travel is made safer and again the technology is nonintrucive. this study, mr. chairman, requested under this amendment would also help to identify any specific environmental and operational factors that might limit these biometriccapabilities and provide insight and information for biometric acquisitions and procedures. it is my hope, therefore, that members will support this amendment. it is a commonsense approach using technology to increasing the level of security at checkpoints. i want to remind my colleagues that this technology is totally, totally nonintrucive and has the potential for improving accuracy and efficiency and safety for t.s.a. personnel and travelers alike. and so mr. chairman, thank you   for recognizing me. thank you, mr. chairman, for giving me this time. at this time i am going to reserve the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman from north carolina reserves the bance of his time. for what purpose does the gentleman from pennsylvania rise? mr. dent: i rise to support this amendment. the chair: without objection, the gentleman is recognized for five minutes. mr. dent: this makes it an exciting new possibility forpeople approaching a security checkpoint. imagine someone with a warrant or fleeing that can be identified as a threat before entering the sterile area of an airport? we may be years away from break throughs in this technology but it certainly does hold some real promise. some would argue this technology goes too far or invades one's privacy but any individual going to a checkpoint must provide identification. this system, if proven   effective, could ensure that documentation provide at the checkpoint is in fact authentic. so for all those reasons, i would urge my colleagues to support this butterfield amendment. it makes sense. and i strongly urge its adoption. at this time i'd yield back the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman from pennsylvania yields back the baffle his time. the gentleman from north carolina. mr. butterfield: i want to thank the gentleman for his support of this amendment and thank him very much for his work here in this body.at this time, mr. chairman, i'd like to yield two minutes to the gentlelady from california, a hardworking member of this homeland security -- the chair: the gentleman from north carolina has 45 seconds remaining. mr. butterfield: i yield to the gentlelady from california 45 seconds. the chair: the gentlelady is recognized for 45 minutes. ms. richardson: this would have facial and iris recognition that would eye bentify individuals at security checkpoints. this study authorizes the ability that we can consider environmental and operational factors and any capabilities that would hinder future   acquisitions. as a member of this committee i support mr. butterfield and our chairman in support of this bill. i ask my colleagues to do the same. i reserve 10 seconds to clear up this amendment. mr. butterfield: mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman from north carolina yields back the balance of his time. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from north carolina. all those in favor say aye. all those opposed, no. in the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it.the amendment is agreed to. it is now in order to consider amendment number 14 printed in house report 111-127. for what purpose does the gentleman from illinois rise? mr. roskam: i have an amendment at the desk. the chair: the clerk will designate the amendment. the clerk: amendment number 14 printed in house report 111-127 offered by mr. roskam of illinois. the chair: pursuant to house resolution 474, the gentleman from illinois, mr. roskam, and a member opposed, each will control five minutes. the chair recognizes the   gentleman from illinois. mr. roskam: i want to thank chairman thompson and the homeland security committee for working with me on this amendment and appreciate their attitude very much and their openness to this suggestion. this is a fairly straightforward amendment and what it's trying to do is mirror the resources of the federal government and to make sure they're in sync with the needs of local transit systems. this actually developed out of a homeland security working group dialogue that i had in my congressional district. i represent the west andnorthwest suburbs of chicago, and a wide range of commuters. we have bus lines and rail lines in the chicago area and there's a certain level of vulnerability. so last march i invited some of the leadership of the public transit systems and some of the security agencies to really offer ideas. and this is one of the ideas that they had. they said, look, we have needs at the local level and there are resources at the federal government, but sometimes those   two things aren't really in sync. and so what this is it says simply that the assistant secretary of homeland security will hold hearings if this amendment was passed and those hearings are really about the subject of whether current allowable uses of grant funds are sufficient to meet the daily needs of the -- the daily security needs and the transit security needs of these local agencies. then after that happens, after that conversation happens inthese hearings to come back to congress and to report. and i think that this is one of these areas where there's a great deal of common ground. there's uncertainty sometimes at the state and local level about how federal funds fit into their agenda. we all know that we in the congress are trying to help and this is a structured way to have that conversation. because when it comes down to it there's nearly 12 million americans that are riding on passenger trains each day.   and that six times as many as fly in our sky. and i think this is a wide use of resources and urge adoption of the amendment. i reserve the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman from illinois reserves the balance of his time. for what purpose does the gentleman from mississippi rise? mr. thompson: mr. chairman, while opposed to the amendment i ask unanimous consent to claim time in opposition. the chair: the gentleman is recognized for five minutes.mr. thompson: mr. chair, mr. roskam's amendment builds on this effort to require t.s.a. to engage in an open and constructive dialogue on the security priorities that matter most to state and local transit agencies. in these difficult times, it is more important than ever that we make sure that our state and local transit agencies are able to maximize their limited resources to implement effective and cost-effective security programs. mr. roskam's amendment supports that effort.   therefore, i urge my colleagues to vote aye on this amendment. and i reserve the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman from mississippi reserves the balance of his time. the gentleman from illinois. mr. roskam: mr. chairman, you know, i want to thank the gentleman for his support and just want other point for the record. the amendment is endorsed by the american public transportation association. i am not aware of any opponents and i appreciate the gentleman's support and i yield back the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman fromillinois yields back the balance of his time. the gentleman from mississippi. mr. thompson: i yield back the balance of my time. the chair: the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from illinois. all those in favor say aye. those opposed, no. in the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. the amendment is agreed to. pursuant to clause 6 of rule 18, proceedings will now resume on those amendments printed in house report 111-127 on which further proceedings were postponed in the following order.","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN : June 4, 2009 3:00pm-3:30pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

this amendment would ensure that the waiver of the administrative procedures act occurs only when there's an imminent threat of finite duration. t.s.a. would still have the   ability to quickly respond to such threats, but if the directive is in place for longer than six months it would be required to conduct the regular rulemaking process. this amendment would refine issuance processes to make it truly responsive to imminent threats and not just the whim of the agency. that's not what we ended. so i ask my colleagues to join other colleagues here in trying to strengthen and clarify thislaw and reserve the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman reserves the balance of his time. the gentleman from mississippi. mr. thompson: mr. chair, i rise in opposition to the amendment. the chair: the gentleman is recognized for five minutes. mr. thompson: mr. chair, i'd like to yield my time to the gentleman from oregon for the purpose of opposition debate. the chair: the gentleman from oregon is recognized. mr. defazio: i thank the   gentleman. at this point i'd yield myself three minutes. i share with the gentleman. he and i helped create the transportation security administration. tremendous frustration with, you know, bureaucracy that gets over the edge for no real purpose. i will not say that the current process is perfect, particularly as it relates to general aviation. we've had a couple of problems, one in which the chairman has been very involved, whatconstitutes a potential threat aircraft, and also the issue of background checks for those who work in the general aviation field. but beyond that many of these directives are based on sensitive security information or even classified information. so they could not very well, if you were dealing, say, with the gel and liquids rule, subject that to the bureaucratic rulemaking process. i don't think the way to solve   inadequate sees and problems with the current -- in adequacies and problems with the current process. i don't think on a normal day the gentleman from florida would ever, you know, present the idea to this congress that we should expand rulemaking and go back and revisit rules that have already been made and put them through a process. he wants more transparency.he wants common sense and he wants stake holder groups an opportunity to intervene. the legislation does bring stake holder groups in the process, particularly as it results to general aviation. the gentleman is going after nonsensical rules and problems. one that happened with a group of aged veterans on a charter aircraft where the chairman has called the agency to account and asked for a review of the procedures they're using.   i would say there's a new era where we are going to make them responsive and responsible and meet our true security needs. but if you impose this on the entire structure, we are going to divert a lot of resources on the transportation security administration over into a bureaucratic, lengthy rulemaking process that is not going to have the flexibility to change, say, the liquids rule from all liquids are banned to, well, prescriptions can go, to so many ounces can go.each of those would have required a six-month to two-year change in the process during which we would be locked into what first emergency rule would be allowed underhe gentleman's amendment. it's not a practical way. i yield back. mr. mica: how much time has left? the chair: the gentleman has two minutes left and the gentleman from florida has 2   1/2 minutes left. the gentleman from florida. mr. mica: i'd like to yield to 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan, mr. ehlers, also a co-sponsor of this amendment. the chair: the gentleman from michigan is recognized for a minute and a half. mr. ehlers: some may ask, why do this?

unemployment rate there is nearly 11%. a figure that was recorded before general motors and chrysler began the restructure chg we already know will lead to more job losses. we also know that these workers who are able to hang on will have to accept significantly reduced compensation packages in order to stay employed. these are tough times regardless of what industry you're in, but think ability   these auto workers, the farmers, the retail workers, who are being forced to do more with less just to keep their job and to keep their head above water. think about them when washington turns around and proposes more generous fringe benefits for public sector pros. . it sends the wrong message at the wrong time and washingtoncontinues to find ways to spend money it doesn't have. i'm disappointed the house will not have the opportunity to consider my amendment. and with that, i yield back to the the gentleman from texas. the speaker pro tempore: the gentleman's time has expired. the gentleman from texas. mr. sessions: thank you so much. and i appreciate the gentleman from new york. madam speaker, i did engage in an agreement with the the gentleman from california. the gentleman has given concurrence. we had another speaker from the republican party who would choose to speak.   going back on my word, but with agreement, the gentleman has allowed me to extend three minutes to the the gentleman from virginia, mr. wolf. the speaker pro tempore: the gentleman is recognized for three minutes. mr. wolf: i think this will be better and i thank the chairman for allowing me to do this. i rise in support of the bill. and i just want to give you some reasons. one i supported the bill in the last session. two, our military, our military today currently gets six weeksof parental paid leave. and the first person killed in afghanistan was from my district, a civilian alongside of the military. and so for the f.b.i., the c.i.a., the d.i.a., d.e.a., a.t.f., they deserve basically the same thing. secondly, i was the ranking member on children, youth and families years eeg. the leading child pediatrician came in and said at the initial   moment of birth, and i have five children and 13 grandchildren and soon to have two more, at the initial moment of birth when the mother breathes on the baby, the bonding process begins. it begins, those early days, weeks are absolutely, positively critical. and so for me on a family issue and a family value issue, i think that's really important.the last thing is, i just want to remind my colleagues that one of the leading people in this congress, one of my heroes, two of the people i looked up to more than anybody, one congressman henry hyde and former congressman dan coates both supported parental leave. the words of henry hyde during the debate on family leave and it was not paid family leave.   he reminded us that, quote, the family supplies the moral glue that holds society together and it is an essential institution that stands between us and social disintegration. and so, one the military gets six weeks. two, that bonding process is when that baby comes out, you want the mother to be there. it is critically important. and thirdly, one of the giants from the beginning in this hallthat ever served, congressman henry hyde who led the most passionate case on why the family leave should have been passed years ago. i rise in support of the bill and i thank the gentleman for yielding me time. i yield back. the speaker pro tempore: the gentleman yields back the balance of his time. the gentleman from texas to close. mr. sessions: i appreciate the gentleman from virginia not only for coming to the floor and the gentleman from california for   allowing me an additional speaker. madam speaker, i we should have a different title for this bill. this bill should be, the bill what congress needs to do to expend federal benefits to federal employees, while knowing in april, there were 611,000 private sector jobs that were lost. that is what should be the name of the bill. this is what congress is goingto do some some three million jobs that have been lost while this administration has been in power. this is the answer to three million job losses in the private sector. we're going to extend benefits, further benefits to the federal government. i understand that, because federal government employment has risen about 100,000. and with car companies and banks and everything else, no telling how many federal employees we'll end up with at the end of this   year. maybe i was wrong. maybe there is a strong demand for federal government employees who want additional benefits. but we should remember that back home where i'm from and where a lot of people are from, 611,000 jobs disappeared in the month of april. and this is the response from our democrat majority and our president. let's go spend more money. new benefits for federal government employees. i get it.i think you will, too, madam speaker, when we hear from people back home. in closing, i would like to reiterate the horrible precedent that this legislation sets. those americans who today that i just talked about, some 611,000 in april alone in the private sector who lost their jobs. millions of americans are jobless and due to the out of control spending of this democrat congress, no analyst or white house official believes   jobs will bounce back this year. nobody. matter of fact, the democratic party is on record that it's going to get worse next year and we're planning on it already. we already understand that. we ought to be saying that instead of extending benefits that's going to cost another $1 billion. why are my friends on the other side afraid of risking more taxpayer dollars to federal employees who have the most job security and excellent benefits? why are they afraid to back awayand wait on this? why are they pushing this? i wonder. i wonder really who is more important and who they're hearing from, because evidently it's not people back home. maybe it is the government workers that they're listening to. maybe government workers are more important to this party than people back home. maybe that's why this is happening.   the republicans are providing quality solutions. we think we understand what the american people are going through. we understand what's happening with the taxing, borrowing and spending. huge deficits and unemployment rates continue on and on and on. i oppo this bill. and i hope that the american people understand that thetaxpayer was heard today on the floor of the house of representatives. they were heard by the speakers of the republican party, which says we should not be extending benefits right now and increase the spending to the cost of $1 billion the next five years. we should understand what real people are going through. i'm going to vote against this bill. i yield back my time. the speaker pro tempore: the gentleman yields. the chair recognizes the   gentleman from california. mr. cardoza: thank you, mr. speaker. i have sat here and listened this evening to the gentleman from texas talk about how this is a terrible waste of dollars and how the republicans are saying that this is a terrible waste of money. but i wish to correct the gentleman. today, this isn't a partisan issue. in fact, i would predict that there are a number of his colleagues, the gentleman fromtexas on the republican side of the aisle like mr. wolf, who understand what this is about. this is about america's children, about children coming into this world and bonding with a mother and a father and having the opportunity to do that in this hectic world that we live in today. it's about foster parents that come in and do the right thing, taking care of abused and victimized children. and needing that time to do it   right. it's about adoptive parents, who when they reach out and bring into their home permanently children who have been victimized by society's ills, having the opportunity to do it right so we can start healing those children. there are a number of republicans on that side of the aisle that are going to do the right thing tonight. they're going to vote for thisrule and vote for this bill because it's the right thing for america and building families. they call themselves the family value party. tonight they can prove it by coming in here and voting to do the right thing. mr. speaker, tonight i would like to submit for the record statement of administration policy. the speaker pro tempore: without objection. mr. cardoza: i provide that to   the speaker. you know, the gentleman from texas talks about how much money this government has wasted. he's right. there's a lot of money that gets wasted. but over the last eight years, as our country was being absolutely raped by those defense contractors in the middle east, with no accountability, where was the gentleman to stand up against that? no, ladies and gentlemen, he's not willing to stand up against that or wasn't the last eightyears, but tonight he will criticize us spending a few dollars to get it right for our families in america. mr. speaker, the fact of the matter is that while most parents wish to stay home with their new child, they just can't afford to take unpaid leave, which directly affects that child's well-being. we can start with having a federal government lead by example, to set the stage for   making changes across the table. to para phrase gandhi, we must be the change we wish to see in this world. i believe that couldn't be more true. i ask the members of both sides of the aisle to support the parents of america, to support the children of america and be the change that we wish for our world.i urge a yes vote on this rule and on the previous question. i yield back the balance of my time. and i move the previous question on the resolution. the speaker pro tempore: the gentleman yields. without objection, the previous question is ordered. the question is on adoption of the resolution. those in favor say aye. those opposed, no. the ayes have it. the resolution is agreed to and the motion to reconsider is laid   upon the table.the speaker pro tempore: pursuant to house resolution 501 and rule 18, the chair declares the house and the committee of the whole for consideration of h.r. 626. the chair apoints the gentlewoman from colorado, ms. deget to preside over the committee of the whole.   the chair: the house is in the committee of the whole house of the state of the union for consideration of h.r. 626, whichthe clerk will report by title. the clerk: h.r. 626, a bill to provide that four of the 12 weeks of parental leave made available to a federal employee shall be paid leave and for other purposes. the chair: pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. the gentleman from massachusetts, mr. lynch and the gentleman from california, mr. issa, each will control 30 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from massachusetts.   mr. lynch: i ask unanimous consent that all members may have five legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks. the chair: without objection, so ordered. mr. lynch: i now yield myself as much time as i may consume. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. lynch: today i rise in strong support of h.r. 626, federal employees paid parental leave act of 2009, which was introduced by our colleague, congresswoman carolyn maloney onjanuary 22, 2009. as chairman of the subcommittee on the federal work force, postal service and district of columbia, i'm proud to serve as an original co-sponsor of this bill, along with 55 other members of congress. h.r. 626 takes an important step toward improving the federal government's ability to recruit and retain highly qualified work force by providing paid parental leave to federal and   congressional employees for birth, adoption or placement of a child from foster care which is a benefit extended to employees in the private sector as well as government employees in other industrialized countries. the subcommittee on the federal work force, postal service and the district of columbia marked up the bill on march 25, 2009 and favorably recommended the measure to the full committee on oversight and government reform.the full committee then held a markup on h.r. 626 on may 6, 2009 and ordered the bill to be reported to the floor by a voice vote. the bilk considered today will allow all federal and congressional employees to receive four weeks of paid leave taken under the family medical leave act, also called the fmlia for the birth, adoption or   placement of a foster child. the current statute provides workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth, adoption or placement of a foster child with an employee, adam chairman. the bill before us does nothing more than permit those federal employees first to receive paid leave for four weeks. out of the 12 weeks to which they're already entitled, and if the leave is connect todd thebirth, adoption or placement of a foster child and secondly, provides employees the employee to use accrued sick or vacation time for the remaining eight weeks. . the bill does not provide workers any additional time or expand beyond the 12 weeks already given under current law. the bill before us has also been strengthened by granting   the director of the office of personnel management the authority to increase paid parental leave from four weeks to eight weeks after considering a thorough cost and benefit analysis. parental leave is a pertinent concern around the world and unfortunately, america is lagging behind in offering paid leave for parents. the governments of 168 countries offer guaranteed paid leave to female employees in connection with childbirth. 98 of these countries offer 14or more weeks of paid leave. currently, the federal government as an employer guarantees zero paid leave for parents in any segment of the workforce, however, h.r. 626, once enacted, will in fact change that. while the 12 weeks of inpaid leave as authorized by the family and medical leave act of 1993 as helped millions of families during some of the most precious moments or in some cases the most challenging times of their lives, most federal employees cannot afford   to take unpaid leave. this often forces these employees to choose between spend manager time with their newborn child or maintaining an income to support their families which is a difficult decision that federal workers will hopefully not have to make after the passage of this federal employees paid parental leave act. the united states of america and in particular the government is supposed to be leaders in this area, yet wehave been followers. i'm sure you'll agree it's high time for us to catch up with the rest of the world and prvide our dedicated employees with paid parental leave for this limited time. providing employees with paid parental leave will improve worker ma role and improvide a more family-friendly environment for federal employees. furthermore, this should not be described as an over-generous or excessive fringe benefit,   but rather as a necessary ben kit to help -- benefice to help strengthen american families and promote the healthy development of our children. we need to recognize that the federal government is the largest employer in the united states and its policies in this area do set a tone for the country. no employee should have to choose between caring for a newborn child or their paycheck. this is especially true in an economic downturn. therefore, madam speaker, i'd like to once again reiterate mysupport for h.r. 626, the federal employee paid parental leave act of 2009, and i urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this measure and i continue to reserve the balance of our time. the speaker pro tempore: the gentleman reserve -- the chair: the gentleman reserves. the gentleman from california. mr. issa: i yield myself such time as i may consume. the chair: the gentleman is recognized. mr. issa: h.r. 626 sends the wrong message at the wrong time to working american taxpayers   and families struggling in difficult times. our economy is in crisis and deficits are already soaring. excess government spending created record deficits and we -- that will continue to rise for years in good times and bad, meaning government already spends too much of the taxpayers' money and has been running deficits before and now during the obama administration. but more than that, jobs are being lost.in the time since the last time this bill was considered, and not passed into law, 4.3 million americans have lost their jobs while 36,000 new federal -- net new federal jobs have been created. my voters, my taxpayers, my constituents are suffering. so are yours, madam speaker. so are the people on the other side. but in fact, there's no suffering in washington. we have some of the lowest   unemployment. we have a growing quality of life. even home prices are not falling very much here. it's not a surprise why. salaries are not falling here. those of us who will speak here today are making nearly $170,000 a year and many of our staff, a great many of our staff make over $100,000 a year, as to a -- as do a great many of the federal workforce. this bill does not have one provision to say, if you make $170,000 a year, why do we have to give you this benefit? because you have to choosebetween feeding your children and being with your children? certainly not. there are no protections against, in fact, those who do not need this special benefit getting it. there are no safeguards at all. as a matter of fact, this bill envisions the $1 billion over five years, or more than $2 billion over 10 years swelling to $4 billion over 10 years or more because in fact it believes it should be eight weeks of special leave.   now in the rules committee, i was told i just didn't understand, that germany gives a year when you have a child. you know, the amazing thing is germany and france and many of these countries are going the opposite direction because they recognize they were losing competitiveness and the generous benefits, though good to have, were unsustainable. they're particularly unsustainable when the only people who can afford it are those who live off the taxpayers -- i'd like to saygenerosity, but this money is taken involuntarily and spent at the whims of congress. madam speaker, federal employees enjoy one of the highest levels of job security without a doubt anywhere in the united states. i would venture to say many of them, the highest. more importantly in good times and bad they keep their jobs. even if you look at the protections against being arbitraryly let go or hired at will, that's not even the   point. the point is, in a bad time, when tens of thousands of auto workers are being laid off, when 40,000 employees of chrysler dealerships have just goten from this administration a 26-day pink notice to go because their franchises have been taken arbitrarily, at that time we've grown the federal government by 36,000 and we're looking at a new benefit that could easily cost $4 billion over the next 10 years. now this bill was scored atnearly $1 billion over five years. but of course that's only if it remains at four weeks. let's talk about those four weeks. this bill is not four weeks. this is 12 weeks. most federal workers, when they retire have a significant amount of accrued, even when they leave in general, accrued sick leave you might ask why. well, because the typical sick leave for federal workers is 13 days a year. that's nearly three weeks a year you get to be sick, on top   of 20, depending on your seniority, 20 to 26 days a year of vacation. so you're looking at five weeks of vacation, on top of that you're looking at nearly three weeks of sick leave. we're being told bhi the majority they can't make those tradeoffs to use some of that when a child is born. it's a joyous occasion when a child is born. it's an important occasion when a child is adopted. it's sometimes a critical timewhen a foster child, battered, beaten, or simply unloved, is brought into the home. the minority has no question at all but the importance of this. it's been a long time since 1993. this is well established to be something in which people make the sacrifices without sacrificing their jobs. we have no objection to the current practice which is common in the federal work force to allow federal employees to take some or all   of their sick leave. as a matter of fact, an amendment which has been ruled in order and will be considered tonight calls for federal employees to be able to use not only their accrued sick leave but borrow against future sick leave, but if they want to take the whole 12 weeks and get a paycheck, we're willing to meet the majority more than halfway. we're willing to make the kind of compromise they'd like to make with the majority.there are safeguards not in this legislation we'd like to see. we'll work with the senate to see if we can get that. but we offer an amendment that would at least cause there to be no net new cost to the american people. and i know that the majority will say, this is pay-go neutral. pay-go is a wonderful term. but let's understand if you create additional days the federal workforce will be off, you can only have one of two   choices, either their labor wasn't needed and as a result doesn't need to be replaced or their labor was needed and will be replaced. replacement costs money. that ultimately will lead to a higher cost. i believe c.b.o.'s scoring of approximately $1 billion over five years is in fact low. but i'm not going to argue with it. we accept theirs because they are in fact a neutral ar by traitor of these differences about what something costs oris worth. so here the republicans are going to offer to support a -- codifying what many agencies are already doing in the federal government, but not without the american people understanding that if we add a new additional off-time benefit of four or eight additional weeks on top of the five weeks and nearly three weeks that are already granted to most federal employees, i think the american people, rightfully so, will   send us packing. they'll send us packing because we would be so out of touch, so inconsistent with what the small mom and pop, and the not so small companies in america are experiencing. earlier, madam speaker, i said that 4,353,000 have been lost between the last time this was considered. that's not the true story. the true story is reflected instate tax revenues and federal tax revenues. we realize it's not just those who lost their jobs but those who lost a great percentage of the earnings they were making on the job. overtime is gone. profit sharing and additional commissions are generally gone. as a result, people aren't just out of work, but people who were still technically fully employed may be making less than half of what they were making a year or two ago. so madam speaker, we on this side of the aisle will oppose   the bill in its current form, but not without offering viable alternatives, reasonable amendments, some ruled, some not ruled in order so we can make this at least a bill that america can understand why we would consider doing it many at a time when so many americans are suffering. with that, i reserve the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman reserves. the gentleman from massachusetts. mr. lynch: thank you, madam speaker. i want to address a couple ofpoints that -- well a single point made by a number of speakers on the other side who i have great respect for, the gentleman from texas earlier and now the gentleman from california. there's a drum beat of justification that seems to be grounded in the fact that the economy is not in good shape right now. that's a fact. in my state, in my district as well as all across america. but before we accept the argument that this is why it's being opposed, this bill is   being opposed at this time, i want to give a brief history. this bill has been presented for 15 years, this bill has been presented for 15 years. before this body. in 2008, when a majority of the republicans opposed this important benefit, the unemployment then was 5.6%. pretty good. during the 109th congress, when the republicans refused to bring this bill to the floor, the unemployment rate was never the unemployment rate was never higher than 5.4%.","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN : June 4, 2009 5:30pm-6:00pm

mr. bachus: i have an amendment   at the desk. the chair: the clerk will designate the amendment. the clerk: amendment number 4, printed in house report number 111-127, offered by mr. bachus of alabama. the chair: pursuant to house resolution 474, the gentleman from alabama, mr. bachus, and a member posed each will control five minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from alabama. mr. bachus: thank you, mr. chair. mr. chair, i think there's some issues that may divide us, but there are other issues that unite us as members. and this is a perfect example of an amendment i think that brings us all together. in fact, this amendment isco-sponsored by dennis moore, my democratic colleague from kansas. and homeland security committee chairman benny tellson was very helpful in -- thompson was very helpful in crafting this amendment. i express my appreciation to you. also the ranking member, peter king, and to the ranking member of the subcommittee, charlie dent. also to the chairman of the subcommittee, ms. sheila jackson   lee. they and the homeland security committee were most helpful. mr. chairman, often as we go through the airports of america we and our constituents see members of the military passing through those airports, many of them are going to iraq and afghanistan. they are leaving their loved ones. facing sometimes an uncertain future. others are coming in from iraq and afghanistan going home to see loved ones. sometimes they hadn't seen them for over a year.they are often loaded down with heavy gear. now, also at the same time we see the registered travelers who we talked about earlier, we see united premium members, we see delta platinum members and gold medallion members. we all see them getting priority. that's ok. i have no problem with that. but if there's any group of americans who ought to get priority to go to the front of the line, not to skip security,   but to go to the front of the line, it's men and women in uniform. so this amendment extends to them the same basic courtesy that we extend to over a million other americans right now. in fact, this is my southwest a list member. i, because i travel, i get to use that. united members do. delta members. but i want to see our military have this same privilege. i will reserve the balance of mytime. the chair: the gentleman from alabama reserves the balance of his time. for what purpose does the gentleman from mississippi rise? mr. thompson: mr. chair, while not opposed to the amendment i ask unanimous consent to claim time in opposition. the chair: without objection, the gentleman is recognized for five minutes. mr. thompson: mr. chair, i'm pleased to support the amendment offered by the gentleman from alabama. it directs t.s.a. to craft special security screening protocols for men and women of the armed forces. all of us have been in airports.   we have seen our men and women returning subject to all kinds of searches. it is absolutely important that we say thank you for putting themselves in harm's way. and i support 100% the directive requiring t.s.a. to set up a protocol to recognize their value to the country. i yield back the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman from mississippi yields back the balance of his time of the the gentleman from alabama. mr. bachus: thank you, mr.chairman. i yield such time as the gentleman, the ranking member of the subcommittee, mr. dent from pennsylvania. the chair: the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized. mr. dent: thank you. i strongly support this amendment by mr. bachus. it's a good amendment. expedited screening services are provided to frequent flyer travelers and registered travelers at our nation's commercial airports all the time. yet our service men and women, many with metal items such as combat boots, medals, badges, often need additional screening.   our brave service men and women are on the frontlines in the fight against terrorism. surely some kind of expedited treatment at an airport scheck point is the least our country can do for them. currently there is no formal t.s.a. requirement or process in place to screen our service men and women in any expedited fashion. at some airports transportation security officers may escort members of the armed forces to the front of the checkpoint, but at other airports no such special treatment is given. so mr. bachus' amendment is an excellent one.it's just common sense that a formal checkpoint screening process should be established for service men and women who sacrifice so much for their country. finally these men and women place themselves in harm's way to the benefit of our american way of life. the very least we can do is make the airport checkpoint experience as smooth and pleasurable as possible. with that i yield the balance of my time back. the chair: the gentleman from alabama. mr. bachus: thank you, mr.   chairman. let me close by saying this. we received a letter in the last two days from a major general abner blaylock who says this amendment will make a big difference for our military and for their families. and i hope it does. i think it's a small gesture that we can make. . i also received an email from a young marine coming back from iraq and this is what he said.as i return from iraq where i had been for over a year, i had to remove my boots and my blouse, military term for battle dress uniform, and then a hand wand was used over my entire body. that was after he waited in line for some period of time. he said he felt humiliated. there is a way to have proper security, and this amendment does nothing to change those   requirements. but we can give those young men in uniform some expedited service. and we also ask t.s.a. to look at when men and women are in uniform under orders to consider an expedited way to get them through security. with that, mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time and i ask all the members to join with me in expressingour appreciation to the men and women who serve us and risk their lives for us every day. the chair: the gentleman from alabama yields back the balance of his time. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from alabama. all those in favor say aye. those opposed, no. in the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. it is now in order to consider amendment number 5 printed in house report 111-127.   for what purpose does the gentleman from florida rise? mr. hastings: mr. speaker, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair: the clerk will designate the amendment. the clerk: amendment number 5 printed in house report 111-127 offered by mr. hastings of florida. the chair: pursuant to house resolution 474, the gentleman from florida, mr. hastings, and a member opposed, each will control five minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from florida. mr. hastings: thank you very much, mr. chairman. i'm pleased to offer an amendment to the transportation security administrationauthorization legislation requiring the t.s.a. to report on the status of passenger property claims. between 2003 and 2008, passengers filed almost $3.5 million in claims for property lost after their bags were mishandled by the t.s.a. including jewelry, electronics and other personal effects. this is unacceptable. the american people already deal with numerous hassles at   the airports. worrying about theft from their luggage should not be one of them. this amendment ensures adequate oversight of the t.s.a.'s efforts to address passenger complaints and claims. this amendment requires the t.s.a. to report on the outstanding claims, their value and the agency's efforts to enhance passenger property security and provide effectiveoversight of bag an screeners and other t.s.a. personnel. mr. chairman, the t.s.a. does an outstanding job of protecting our nation's airports and ensuring the safety and security of the tens of millions of passengers who access our air transportation network each year. this authorization bill, and i compliment chairman thompson and his staff as well as the   ranking member and their staff for offering this very good bill. it offers us an opportunity to improve the t.s.a.'s operations and ensure that all americans can rest assured that their property is safely cared for under the control of t.s.a. personnel. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and i reserve the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman fromflorida reserves the balance of his time. for what purpose does the gentleman from pennsylvania rise? mr. dent: thanks, mr. chairman. i rise to claim time in opposition to the amendment although i am not opposed to the amendment. the chair: without objection, the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for five minutes. mr. dent: thank you, mr. chairman. this would require the t.s.a. to report on a number of claims that it receives for lost and damaged property as well as the value of that property and resolve such claims. the men and women of the t.s.a. work hard every day to protect the property entrusted into   their care. while the underlying premise is faulty in that it assumes t.s.a. personnel are to blame for loss or damages associated with baggages, information gleamed from this report might prove useful to manage these claims. the t.s.a. has instituted a process in which a tag is placed inside every bag they open and inspect. this includes bags that are sealed and require forcible entry. unfortunately, the traveling public is sometimes quick to blame the t.s.a. for any loss or damage associated with theirluggage as opposed to the air carriers, baggage handlers or a simple error in bar coding scanning. this may find improvements to the t.s.a. notifications and claims process. i support the amendment and at this time i'd yield back the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman from pennsylvania yields back the balance of his time. the gentleman from florida. mr. hastings: mr. speaker, i am prepared to yield back the balance of my time and i do so.   the chair: the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from florida. all those in favor say aye. those opposed, no. in the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. the amendment is agreed to. it is now in order to consider amendment number 6 printed in house report 111-127. for what purpose does the gentleman from florida rise? mr. diaz-balart: mr. chairman, i have ask unanimous consent that my amendment be modified in the form i have placed at the desk. the chair: the clerk willdesignate the amendment and report the modification. the clerk: amendment number 6 printed in house report 111-127 offered by mr. lincoln diaz-balart of florida. modification to amendment number 6 printed in house report 111-127 offered by mr. lincoln diaz-balart of florida. the amendment as modified is as follows. in section 237 of the bill insert, a, process, before section 1604-b-2.   insert at the end the following, b, reimbursements of airports for eligible cost reimbursement at less than 90%. of the secretary or assistant secretary reimbursed after all 3, 2007, an airport that incurred an amount for eligible cost under section 44923 of title 49, united states code, that was less than 90% of such cost, the secretary or assistant secretary shall reimburse such airport under such section in an amount equalto such eligible cost. the chair: is there objection to modify the amendment? without objection, the amendment is modified. pursuant to house resolution 474, the gentleman from florida, mr. diaz-balart, and a member opposed, each will control five minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from florida. mr. diaz-balart: thank you, mr. chairman. and i'd like to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for his consideration and another clear demonstration of the bipartisanship on this   house floor. mr. chairman, i rise to offer an amendment that is a matter of simple fairness to airports that are installing connelly mandated, in-line explosive detection systems, known as e.d.s. airports that were offered t.s.a. discretionary funding for e.d.s. projects in 2008 were not treated equally.this was due to funding language that in effect pitted airports against each other depending on if they were awarded in f.w. 2008 -- fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2007 appropriations. in the fall of 2008, t.s.a. had funding at its disposal from fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008 to distribute e.d.s. reimbursement funds.   some airports received federal discretionary grants for 90% of the grants of installing the e.d.s. for airport baggage systems from the f.y. 2008 appropriations. at the same time other airports were given grants for 75% of their costs from f.y. 2007 appropriations. both of these awards were distributed at the same time, in the fall of 2008. miami international airport, which is located in the district that i'm honored to represent, and several otherlarge airports around the country fell into the 75% category. and these airports are now at a competitive disadvantage which increases costs to the airlines and, of course, to the flying public that ultimately pays the bills. the t.s.a. and the o.m.b. made an arbitrary funding decision. they picked winners and losers based on no known criteria. this amendment simply restores fairness to t.s.a.'s discretionary funding of e.d.s.   projects and assures that these critical airport security projects can be completed in a timely basis. again, i'd like to thank chairman thompson and ranking member king and their staffs for working with my office to perfect this amendment, and i reserve the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman reserves the balance of his time. for what purpose does the gentleman from mississippi rise? mr. thompson: mr. chairman, while not opposed to the amendment i ask unanimous consent to claim time in opposition. the chair: without objection,the gentleman from mississippi is recognized for five minutes. mr. thompson: thank you very much. mr. chair, this is a classic example of a commonsense amendment. there's no reason why some airports should be reimbursed at 90% and others at 75%. this corrects that inequity. we support it. i yield back the balance of my time. the chair: the gentleman from mississippi yields back the balance of his time. the gentleman from florida. mr. diaz-balart: yield back. the chair: the gentleman from florida yields back. the question is on the amendmented a modified offered   by the gentleman from florida. all those in favor say aye. those opposed, no. in the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. the amendment is adopted. it is now in order to consider amendment number 7 printed in house report 111-127. for what purpose does the gentlewoman from florida rise? ms. castor: mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair: the clerk will designate the amendment. the clerk: amendment number 7 printed in house report 111-127 offered by ms. castor of florida. the chair: pursuant to house resolution 474, the gentlewoman from florida, ms. castor, and a member opposed, each willcontrol five minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from florida. ms. castor: thank you, mr. chairman. mr. chairman, i'm pleased to offer an amendment that promotes economic growth and fairness. my amendment eliminates redundant and expensive additional background checks that are making the transportation worker i.d. card less effective and keeping qualified verified workers from jobs at our ports. the transportation worker i.d. card was designed to ensure that people working at our ports are not security risks.   we now verify that port workers have not been involved in activities related to terrorism or other serious criminal activities. the twic harmonizes port security across the nation so that any port authority in the country can be secure in the knowledge that job applicants have been examined by the t.s.a. and deemed qualified and safe to access our ports. while the transportation worker i.d. card has standardized port security for the vast majority of states, in florida a workerwho holds that national twic card is still not allowed to access ports without additional background checks and additional fees under a parallel and duplicative state-run system. that's not fair. a trucker delivering a load to a port in georgia or south carolina can simply present the twic card and make his or her delivery as congress intended when we -- when the twic program was designed.   however, the same trucker in florida will have to pay additional fees because the state refuses to recognize the twic as a sufficient security credential. florida is the only state in the country to require two security clearances to enter public sea ports. these duplicative clearances not only defeat the purpose of having a federal port security credential but they put florida sea ports, tenants, trucking companies and workers at acompetitive disadvantage. and this is hurting florida's economy. it's a terrible burden on business. now, in 2007, this congress directed t.s.a. to work with florida to come to a mutually agreeable solution that would allow the twic to serve its purpose, but the ensuing years said they would not accept the national standard for port security but would continue to require expensive, duplicative   and unnecessary extra background checks. the criminal background checks are almost identical. both screen for crimes such as trafficking in narcotics, robb","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN : June 4, 2009 2:08pm-2:30pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

members permitted to speak for ten minutes. the presiding officer: without   objection. mr. burr: mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 30 minutes. the presiding officer: without objection, so ordered. mr. burr: mr. president, we're desperately working to try to make sure that we can move to amendments on h.r. 1256, a bill that attempts to consolidate the regulatory responsibility for tobacco products under the f.d.a.mr. president, this is being sold as a public health bill. i've been now to the floor for over three and a half hours the balance of this week suggesting that it doesn't meet that threshold. and that at some point today i would have the opportunity, along with senator hagan, my colleague, to give in some detail what's in the substitute amendment. i'm going to attempt to do that   now, even though we haven't moved to the consideration of the other pending amendments. let me start with a chart that i have used earlier today. the reason that i make the claim this is not a public health bill, because this is a chart that shows the continuum of risk of tobacco products, and it starts on my right, your left with nonfiltered cigarettes. and the baseline that we use is that's 100% risky. and the industry at some point,probably before i was born, all of a sudden created a filter that went on the end of a nonfiltered cigarette. because of that filter, it eliminated, it removed some of the constituencies of the come pwuplgs of tobacco and that made it 10% less risky. the risk went from 100% to 90%. then in the 1990's we have a new product that was never marketed except in test markets, and it   was a tobacco heating cigarette where it didn't actually burn tobacco. it heated the tobacco, extracted the nicotine, delivered the nicotine in the system but never produced smoke. that product was considered to be about 45% risky. but clearly, a reduction at the time of 45%. now all of a sudden in the past 12 months, 18 months we've seen a new product called theelectronic cigar. no tobacco is burned. it's a fairly expensive product. it's popular outside of the united states. not as popular, not as readily available in the united states. but that electronic product that has a cartridge that you replace, actually brought the risk level down to about 18%. some might be catching on. as we've introduced new products, we've brought the risk down, the health risk, the risk of disease, of death.   now we're over here to u.s. smokeless tobacco, a product that most americans understand. it's not the old snuff that parents and grandparents grew up with. it is ground tobacco, and all of a sudden we realized that we reduced even further the health risk. it's now down at the 10% risk level, 90% below where we started decades ago with an unfiltered cigarette.introduced into the marketplace in the past year something i refer to as swedish smokeless. it's now on the market and it's sold and pasteurized and it's spitless. and it wasn't something that the united states or u.s. tobacco companies created. it's something that the swedes created. and part of what i will get into is how the swedes have used this product and other innovative products, other new products on the marketplace to move smokers   from very risky products to less risky products, and in the case of swedish snuse you see a risk of maybe 10%. and then a dissolvable tobacco product, one that was covered under cnn as a candy, one thatstill meets the age requirements of -- and proof of i.d. for somebody to purchase, but to magnify cnn's report, they actually took that product from behind the counter and put it in the candy section next to reese's cups and gums and had an underage person come up and take one as cnn filmed to make it even that more appealing from the standpoint of a story. but this is the product. this is the product.   some have come to the floor of the senate and said it looks like a cell phone. i'm not sure -- it doesn't look like my cell phone. maybe it looks like somebody's cell phone, but not mine. it's not a product that's accessible for anybody who doesn't produce an i.d. and doesn't meet the minimum age requirements of that state. risk, about 1% or 2%. we're ac-- actually getting innovative. gums, patches, pharmaceuticals, negligible. the bill that is considered the base bill, 1256, takes these categories right here. nonfiltered cigarettes and filtered cigarettes, and it locks them in forever. the legislation says to the   f.d.a., you cannot change these categories. unless you find some specific thing that would cause you to alter it. it forbids the f.d.a. and 1256, even though it creates a pathway to less harmful products, it's a pathway that can't be met because one of the conditions of new products entering the marketplace is you have to prove that people don't today use tobacco products won'tbe enticed to use these products. but it also says in 1256 that you can't communicate with anybody in the public unless you've got a product that's approved. so i ask you, mr. president, how do you meet the threshold of proving that somebody that doesn't use tobacco products is not going to use this product if you can't communicate with them until you get the product approved by the f.d.a.   i've come to the conclusion since nobody who is a cosponsor or author of the bill has come up with an answer to me, that it can't be done. so to claim that this is a public health bill, one would have to make a reasonable claim that these products are going to be available and maybe potentially products in the future. but what h.r. 1256 does is it cuts off the availablity of products right here and it says on this side of the line we'veconstructed a pathway that nothing will pass. i don't believe that you can make a genuine claim that this is a public health bill when you have locked every user into the 90% or 100% category of risk. senator hagan and i have presented a substitute amendment. that substitute amendment, i believe, will be voted on about 4:30 today if things go   according to schedule. and i think it's absolutely essential that the members of the united states senate listen to their staffs who have read the bill, read the substitute amendment, listened to the debate. because i know there are a lot of things that go on during the day and it just doesn't require -- doesn't allow a member of the united states senate to sit down and listen to what richard burr is going to say.hopefully the staff has looked at the statistics i presented, looked at the facts i brought to the table, looked at the claims that i've made and understand that i'm right. 1256 is not a public health bill. the substitute does allow this to happen. and we allow it to happen because the substitute doesn't concentrate regulation in the food and drug administration, an agency by their mission statement is required to prove   efficacy, pharmaceuticals, biologics, medical devices, food safety, cosmetics, products that emit radiation. that's the world of the f.d.a. they regulate 25 cents of every dollar of the u.s. economy. they are the gold standard for every american when they get a prescription and they go home to take that, they never wonder whether it's safe or whether it will work. because the gold standard in theworld is the food and drug administration. that when they go to a doctor's office and they get ready to use a device on them, they don't question whether that device was something that the doctor made in a back room. they know that device was approved by the food and drug administration. up until recently they had every assurance when they went and bought food, that food wasn't contaminated, that it wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't kill them. but, as we know over the past several years, we've had things   that have slipped through and americans have died. and the food and drug administration is struggling today to makake sure that, in fact, they meet the demands of the regulation that they've got in place. so what i'm trying to say to my colleagues is don't concentrate this regulation at the food and drug administration. don't jeopardize the gold standard. employees there work there with a complete understanding that ifit doesn't pace safety and efficacy, it does -- does not pass safety and efficacy, it does not receive approval of the f.d.a. let me say it like i said it a couple of hours ago, mr. president, tobacco products are not safe. tobacco products cause disease and death. there is no way that the food and drug administration on their current mission statement can regulate a product they can't prove safe and effective.   if you try to put a square peg in a round hole, you will have reviewers at the food and drug administration that say, you know, the gold standard is no longer important, because congress has legislated that it's not important. if i turn my head on tobacco products, i can turn my head on this medical device, because it doesn't look like it's going to be dangerous, and, you know what? all of a sudden something will slip through the crack.we're going to have a pharmaceutical product that will do damage, a device that will do damage because we have lowered the threshold that every product must meet to get f.d.a.'s approval. i'm not advocating for the f.d.a. to do nothing. we need to reduce death an disease associated with tobacco   and reduce youth usage of tobacco products and that's exactly what senator hagan's and my substitute amendment does. it is designed to keep kids from smoking. but you can't keep kids from smoking if you're not willing to limit advertising. in the base bill, h.r. 1256, they limit print advertising to black and white. in the substitute amendment we eliminate print advertising. let me say that again.in the current base bill that's being considered, they restrict print advertising to black and white only. in the substitute amendment, we eliminate the ability for print advertising. the substitute amendment is actually tougher on advertising than is the base bill. specifically senator hagan and my amendment bans outdoor advertising, youth organize the   sponsorships, sponsorship of events that youth attend and many other provisions designed to limit children's exposure to tobacco advertising. our amendment does not stop at print advertising. my amendment codifies the other youth marketing restrictions contained in the master settlement agreement of 1998 and makes it a crime for underaged youth to possess tobaccoproducts. let me say that again. in 1998 all of the tobacco companies got together responding to state concerns that health care costs were out of control and tobacco contributed to it. and they provided $280 billion to all 50 states for two things, cost-share of their health care, and so they could create programs -- cessation programs to get people to quit.   i covered in great detail over the last couple of days that even with this money available one state only spent 3.7% -- not of their total money, of the amount of money that c.d.c. said was an adequate number to do cessation programs. there was nobody, no state thathit 100%. there were some that deserved gold medals for the fact that they were higher than others. i pointed out one yesterday and i'll point it out again, the state of ohio, it's a large state. the state of ohio of the c.d.c. recommended amount that ohio should take of tobacco money and devote it to cessation programs, ohio spent 9% of what the c.d.c. recommendation was. when you hear these numbers, no   wonder that we're not doing better at moving people off of cigarettes to other products or getting them to quit all together. it's because the effort that we made through education has been pitiful. as a matter of fact 21.6% of the youth in ohio have a prevalence to smoke. 45% have a prevalence to alcohol. 17.7% have a prevalence to smoke marijuana. yet some come to the floor andclaim if we just give this to the f.d.a., youth smoking, youth usage is going to go away. if that -- if that claim were even partially correct, the marijuana usage would be zero. because it is illegal. there's no age limit. well, mr. president, some will claim that we don't address labeling. we address labeling on packages   of cigarettes to discourage children from even looking at them. we require warning levels on the front and the back of packs. we require graphic warning labels that show graphic lung cancer and mouth cancer and other pictures to deter kids from smoking. as my colleagues can see, keeping kids from tobacco advertising is a key component to the burr-hagan substitute amendment.compare that with the underlying bill and you won't see the same commitment to limit advertising that children will see. the underlying bill contains graphic warning labels, but doesn't limit print advertising. tobacco companies would still be able to advertise in magazines such as ""people,"" ""u.s. weekly"" and ""glamour,"" clearly purchased by their parents and accessed by   their kids and see the ads. maybe in some weird way authors of the bill that children can't read black and white, that they can only read color, and that's why they chose to limit it to only black and white advertising. the only stipulation is that the ads would be in black and white. we can do better. we can absolutely do better than this. keeping children from using tobacco products must be the first accomplishment of federal regulation. senator hagan's and my amendment accomplishes that goal with atwo prong attack. first our amendment encourages states to use more of their m.s.a. payments on cessation, putting billions of dollars into the effort. in the last 10 years states used just 2.3% of their tobacco generated money for tobacco prevention an cessation and in 2009 no state is funding tobacco prevention levels at c.d.c. levels 678 our amendment would require states to comply with   the c.d.c. recommended spending levels on tobacco cessation levels. it would no longer be tolerable instead of spending 2.5% of the c.d.c., ohio would be required to spend what the c.d.c. says needed to be spent to successfully make sure that our nation's children were given the message that the use of tobacco products is not an sangu add vasthing. unfortunately, mr. president, the underlying bill, h.r. 1256, contains no cessation program. even though the bill requires the manufacturers to pay up t to $700 million a year, it   contains no cessation program. again, how can you call this a public health bill? how can you suggest that this is going to reduce the death or disease. how can you make the claim that you're going to reduce youth usage when there's no commitment, no requirement to cessation? secondly, our amendment assists current smokers who are unableand unwilling to quit by acknowledging a continuum of risk of tobacco products. exactly what i showed you here. more specifically our amendment does not preclude reduced products from entering the marketplace. this piece here, they like this end, we pull this, the 90%, to less harmful products. because the objective in this bill should be to reduce death an disease.   -- and disease. there's a great debate under way in the academic world on tobacco control. some advocate abolishment of tobacco. straight abolishment is hard to achieve and can bring many unintended consequences such as illicit trade and we all know that. since abolishment is not an elective solution, the question remains: how do we","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 4, 2009 2:30pm-3:00pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

hear about a bill that would transfer stock in the twoauto companies directly from the government to taxpayers. from capitol hill earlier today, this is 25 minutes. >> lamar alexander, with me, senator kyl is going to join the senate humans. he is coming from the finance committee. we are introducing today the auto stock for every taxpayer act to require the treasury to   distribute to individual taxpayers all the stock in the new gm and chrysler within one year following the emergence of the new gm from bankruptcy proceedings. this is the best way to get the auto companies out of the hands of washington bureaucrats and politicians and into the hands of the american people in the marketplace where it belongs. so instead of the treasury polling 60% of the shares of new gm and 8% of shares of chrysler,he went on them. if you are one of 120 million americans who paid federal taxes on april 15th. this is the fastest way to get the stock out of the hands of washington and back into the hands of the american people who paid for it. to keep it simple and to help the little guy also get an ownership stake in america's future, the treasury would give each taxpayer an equal number of the available shares. the treasury department has said it wants to sell the shares as soon as they can, but the   president of general motors said in a phonecall with the number of us in congress a couple of days ago that this is a very large amount of stock and that an orderly offering of the shares might take several years. lease shares might not be worth very much at first, but put them away and one day they might contribute some something to a college education. for example general motors 610 million shares were worthonly 75 cents just before bankruptcy but they were worth $40 a couple of years before that and $75 a few years before then. already we are beginning to see what government ownership of car companies looks like. yesterday the president of gm and chrysler spent four hours of the four congressional committees talking about dealerships. i assume they drove themselves here in congressionally approved methods of transportation, probably their own hybrid cars.   that meant they didn't have any time yesterday to design cars, to build cars or to sell cars. unless we get the stock out of the hands of washington this is going to be repeated over and over and over and over again. there are 60 committees and subcommittees in washington who can summoned the heads of the auto companies here to give advice about how to do their jobs. car companies executives you want to be managing complex companies will be reduced to thestatus of an assistant secretary moving from subcommittee to subcommittee, holling briefing books. you can just imagine what the questions will be next week, what is the next model going to be? what color will lead paint be? which plan should be closed? why don't you open one in my congressional district? comminate carson have lech steel? what should the work rules be? which of the salaries be in the executive offices? where can conferences be held? someone will want to know why   the gm volt is buying a battery made in south korea and said that in that congressman congressional district. there will be lengthy questions about the number of holidays. thomassen some of written questions demanding thousands of written answers, all of it under oath so lots of lawyers will need to be involved. it is not just the congress we have to worry about. the president has already called the mayor of detroit and assured him that he is on his side in keeping the headquarters of gianin detroit so the executives want move it to michigan and the mayor of detroit he-- his head planet conversations with members of the auto task force to have assured him there on his side as well. then there's the treasury secretary and the undersecretaries it wants to keep up with what is happening to the taxpayers $50 billion. there is a very active economic czar in the white house used to be the president of harvard. there is, there are the epa   officials who want to be telling them what size cars to build a and it was not very long ago that the administration told the general motors it was building too many suv's and that its old was too expensive to work and the president himself find the president of general motors of giving the stock to the taxpayers who actually pay for it is the only way to get the government out of the company's hair and give them a chance tosucceed. and, it will create an investor fan base of 120 million or so americans who are now stockholders and the companies who may be little more interested in what the next model chevy might be. thank you-- this ownership is the judy among the people of green bay. this is the fastest way to get back to the wise principle. if you confided in the yellow pages the government ought not to be doing it.   more than the money, it is the principle of the thing. the other day a visiting european automotive executives said to me with a laugh, that he had come to the new american automotive center, washington dc. to get our economy moving again, let's get our auto companies out of the hands of washington politicians and bureaucrats and back into the marketplace in the hands of american investors. the sooner the better.>> when lamar described this amendment that he has just described to you and i said, i have an amendment that will fit perfectly and so i have joined my amendment to his and we will be offering it as the alexander bennett amendment or as i suppose it will be known in utah, the bennett alexander amendment. there will obviously be a period of time before the stock can be   distributed. he has anticipated roughly a year. it in that period of a year, the secretary of the treasury will be in charge of controlling the stock, so my amendment will give the secretary of treasury my portion of this amendment, will give the secretary of the treasury the same fiduciary responsibility that and a director or official in a company would have. we talk about conflict of interest here in washington agreat deal and conflict of interest is not a good thing. the secretary of the treasury finds himself in a position of a conflict of interest. he has his interest as the chief financial officer, if you will of the federal government, and conflict of that with his position running an auto company or at least overseeing the running of an auto company. the president of the united states has said, we don't want to run an auto company, so i say could come as good on you   mr. president. we will set up a circumstance with this amendment, or the secretary of the treasury has a responsibility to the shareholders, the same as if he were a ceo or a member of the board of directors of a private company. and therefore, in discharging that fiduciary responsibility we have removed the conflict of interest. we have made it clear that he will be subject to the same kinds of laws and regulations, and yes perhaps shareholderlawsuits that anyone would be in a position of fiduciary responsibility in the company. i think by doing that, i will spur the desire of the secretary of the treasury to comply with senator alexander's part of the amendment and get rid of this stock as fast as he possibly can for give giving it to the american people, who have paid for it, strikes me as a good idea.   another portion of my amendment says comment no more t.a.r.p. money can go to a bankrupt company. the t.a.r.p. money was sold to the congress as acquiring assets, not as a quiring stock positions in various companies and particularly, not in the acquiring a stock position in a bankrupt manufacturing company. approved aarp the first time around we did it with the understanding that it wasdealing with a credit crisis and a financial meltdown that we were facing around the world, and instead the t.a.r.p. money has gone into these bankrupt companies and once again, the question in of conflict of interest, i am saying there must be no conflict of interest with respect to how the t.a.r.p. money is being spent, so the treasury secretary says well, wearing my hat, looking out for the benefits of general motors i am going to suddenly switch and take my hat as the treasury   secretary and determined that some t.a.r.p. money is going to go to relieve my problems as an executive overseeing the auto companies, so those are the two aspects of the addition that i am making two senator alexander's amendment. number one, we are giving the secretary of the treasury the same kind of fiduciary responsibility and therefore exposure that any officer or director would have any corporate opportunity and at the same time we are saying no moret.a.r.p. money mr. secretary, whichever hat you may be wearing gang goes to one of the bankrupt auto companies. >> i support the kyl-- i'm just teasing. i am proud to be a co-sponsor of the alexander bennett amendment because they joined to excellent ideas together in something i think is critical. first of all understand, the american people are fed up with the notion of the federal government taking over businesses and running those   businesses. barda this is in response to that, but there is a very good governance aspect of this that i want to bring to your attention. you know the government of the united states of america is made up of the people. the people came first. it is we the people in order to form a more perfect union get together and give the government some of our rights and then we will see where it goes from there because are the people of the government in the united states. when we talk about the government on something, it is the people who own it, so it isthat people who should have the shares of stocks, not the government. that is the first idea here, that the stock in this company that the people now on will be held by the people. now it is not just an abstract notion. the second important reason for what senator alexander is doing here and senator bennett alluded to is that it would not be a good financial thing for the   united states government to have to sell off all of the stock in a relatively short period of time and of course we don't want the government to hold the stock for a long period of time. why? because it essentially is a fires still. everybody in the market knows the government has to unload 60% of the company. are they going to rush out and pay high dollar for it? no, they are going to pay low dollar. the dahlia the government would give that would not represent the true, the ultimate value webelieve of the stock. if it is held, on the other hand, by millions of individual taxpaying americans, some may want to cash in right away, some may want to hold that. muscle believe there is a significant upside potential and may give it to their kids, and hold it for a long time. i think frankly that is what is going to happen if the company is run right and it will be run right with the editions of the bennett concept to the amendment. so, you don't want the   government to an defected rid of these docket fires all prices. the nobody benefits and that is the second very practical reason. we the people should have the stock and secondly it will make the most sense from a long-term value perspective. senator bennett has spoken to the reasons why the fiduciary responsibility ""is also important at play here. i hope that rather than viewing this as some kind of partisan exercise, our democratic colleagues will listen to theirconstituents back home who were not happy about the way things are going with government takeovers these days and will see the value for them in adopting this amendment. this is an amendment, a bill that should be adopted, and i am very hopeful that democratic colleagues will join us in seeing that that happens. >> any questions? >> have you gotten any reaction from the auto task force or the administration and is there any concern about the complexity of   doing something like this? i don't know how easy it would be to distribute it to taxpayers. >> the irs knows where to find as one april 15 kuntz so they can find is when it is giving us something. the irs did not have some-- trouble with tax rebates. they have the names, addresses and electronic files on 120 million people. at.to be relatively easy to get doc to them. typically in the woodstock is handled in america today thecompany holds the stock certificates on behalf of the individual owners, so a battle-- let the 120 million americans now you have a few shares of stock in gm and chrysler and when it is time to sell its hugo through the process. it should be relatively simple. >> any response from the administration to suggest this to them? >> i have not suggested it to the administration. i been thinking about it for several weeks. it seems to me to be perfectly   obvious, and then when-- the president of gma bikler, it is the treasury's decision when they still the stock according to the with the law is today but he said it is a large amount of stock and senator kyl said selling it would have to probably be done in stages over a period of years ago this could be done in a few months and it would mean we would have 120 million or so americans own general motors and chrysler. that is 60% of gm.>> uaw fun the hans about 17%. that is nonvoting. the government of canada owns 12% and the bondholders holding the rest. the american company would be back the way companies are supposed to operate and the president instead of driving their hybrids from detroit to washington every day, to answer some subcommittee's questions about the next car model could focus on designing and building and selling cars in competing in trying to make the value of the stock go up.   >> senator alexander, with some money auto-- in your home state would you support legislation that would protect a percentage of those jobs in tennessee or any other states? >> i don't know what kind of legislation that would be. i believe in the free market. the jobs are in tennessee. we have gone from having almost no auto jobs to one-third of our audra jobs because we are the best competitive place to build cars. we have a right to work law andother states don't ago we have one of the best for lane highway systems and other states, so that is why nissan has been the most efficient auto plant in america and many times, way of volkswagon show's tennessean the springhill plant of gm will be successful. >> would support any legislation that would try and commit the government to protect american jobs? >> no, you can't run a country that way. that is the direction we are   headed. i am trying to go the other way. i am trying to say let the free market or can get the stock out of washington so everyone in washington ""to run the car companies. >> it may be more efficient for gm to downsize their headquarters but the president is quickly on the phone with the mayor of detroit saying, don't worry we are going to keep the headquarters there in detroit. that is exactly the kind of political decision that has no place in the running of the company for the value of the stockholders. >> on jobs-- we have seen steadydrops in claim numbers but also, no one are you and wheatridge by that and what you think we are going to see? >> i want try to forecast what we are going to see tomorrow. the unemployment problem is of course a serious one and it is a tragic one for those people who have lost their jobs. and, i say that as one who has lost my job at various points in   my career and as one who has seen my son who lose his job in the financial crisis. and it is a time of great, great difficulty for the individuals and for their families. fortunately, my son found another job and i have found another job that i'm trying to keep. that having been said however, one of the things we have learned is that artificialattempts to maintain employment that go against market forces prolong recessions and sometimes turn them into depressions. and there is evidence with respect to the great depression now, as we go back and study that, that many of the things that were done in the name of protecting jobs in the great depression in fact caused it to last years longer than it otherwise might have done. you can read the literature on   that income to your own conclusion as to how condensing it may be. the most important thing we must do is get manufacturing and all of those parts of the supply chain that support manufacturing back in a healthy condition again. and it is not just automobiles. it is every portion of the economy that needs to come back. u.s. about individual states. in my state the last time i think we had the unemployment rate, it was 4.8%.i expect it will be higher than that as the recession continues to have its problems. but that is significantly below where it is in many other states and that underscores the fact that, while there are national unemployment rates, they vary dramatically from one region of the country to the other. the recovery is uneven. there are some parts of the country where housing prices have stabilized and indeed some   where they are actually rising. remember, this whole thing was caused by the bursting of the housing bubble so that housing starts to get fixed, that is the most important single thing that can be done to get the recession fix. other parts of the country where the housing prices still are dropping and frankly need to drop before you get stability, so we will look at the national numbers with interest, but the solution to the problem will come from the economy and theactual creation of employment activity region by region. [inaudible] >> doing something like what? [inaudible] >> i supported the first round of t.a.r.p. because it was to prevent an international meltdown of the financial system and i believe it did, and i   believe it was justified. i have voted against every other distribution because i disagree with the way they are being managed and maybe good intentions, but i am not at all sure they are going to be as successful as their-- their supporters said they would be. >> annie last questions? >> i was actually going to ask the same questions. >> gm is of course it that the delay in a stock company.there is other equity and debt. i don't think that is the situation with aig. i think obviously he would have to look at it to see but i don't think that is the situation. >> that taxpayer on 60% of the new gm. it will own 8% of chrysler. that is very straightforward, very simple. we can distribute that to the taxpayers within a matter of months. the bank stocks and warrants that we may own could be more complicated. i was not willing to include that as part of it but i am   studying it. >> i am sorry, i misunderstood your question. i agree with his answer. [laughter] >> thank you. >> thank you...commercial free as a public service.    we are joined by the financial times middle east editor. who are the players in this upcoming iran and presidential election? >> well, the first player is somebody that i am sure your viewers know very well, mahmoud ahmadinejad, the current president. he is facing three rivals in this election. the most prominent is","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 4, 2009 6:30pm-7:00pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

>> you know, until about a week or ten days ago, everyone that we speak to in iran was telling us that although there are no a incredible opinion polls mahmoud ahmadinejad seems to be a clear front runner but seems it's shifted in the last week or sobecause mir-hossein mousavi appears to have gained strength. to what extent can he really challenge mahmoud ahmadinejad remains to be seen. usually in 83 year on election makes it does run so i think people will be watching very carefully over the next few days to see how well mir-hossein mousavi's message of more moderation is received by people. >> tell us about some of the main issues in this election.   >> i would say there are two main issues. obviously for the iranian voters, the state of the economy is very important. iran now has lower oil revenues, and at the same time it has faced the theories of sanctions that complicated the way iranian business operates and has made it much more difficult for people.at the same time, iranians are suffering high inflation over 20%. these are issues that worked against president mahmoud ahmadinejad at this point. on the other hand though, he has distributed a lot of money, a lot of handouts to people like salaries, distributed justice shares and shares in big state enterprises. so the poor segment of the population has actually overseen   their economics attrition improve in some ways. >> dayron's use of nuclear power is an issue in the united states, is also a part of the election as well? >> malt nuclear, not the nuclear program perce. what is an issue in the election is the foreign policy mahmoud ahmadinejad has followed. all his rivals have been attacking him for what they sayis humiliating iran, attacking iran's dignity, undermining its dignity through turning iran into a state so the nuclear program isn't addressed directly because all the candidates say that they are for the nuclear program and that they would not send uranium enrichment as u.n. security council resolution have been demanding.   but more generally, foreign policy is a major issue in the election. >> what will do the six debates play in the election? >> well, there was a very heated debate last night between mahmoud ahmadinejad and mir-hossein mousavi, and i think that this is the first for iran. iranians have never seen such debate. and i think that it will make a difference, although, you know, it was difficult last night to decide whether one of them hadwon the the date. but i think that it does introduce them to the candidates much, much better. you have to remember that the rifles to the president have only been given tv time for the couple of weeks before that the president essentials and had on television and all media. >> tell about the supreme leader and how he figures and to both the election and politics in   general in iran. >> the supreme leader is the ultimate decision maker on iran on issues of foreign policy, the nuclear program of course. in this election officially he is -- he does not take sides and he keeps saying he doesn't take sides but from his public statements and indeed today for instance he made a public statement that again suggests that he favors mahmoud ahmadinejad.within the regime though there are other leading figures, such as the former president and mohammed khatami backing mir-hossein mousavi. >> from blonden we have been speaking with roula khalaf, financial times middle east editor. thanks for joining us. >> thanks. next a portion of the debate from june 3rd between president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his   leading opponent, mir-hossein mousavi. our coverage of this event is courtesy of state ron iran and network press tv. >> [speaking farsi] >> translator: the words of channel to this is a televised debate of presidential hopefuls. tonight we have to president candidates, dr. mahmoudahmadinejad and mir-hossein mousavi. i wish to greet you both and welcome you. why don't you have a few words with the viewers of the program. let's start with mahmoud ahmadinejad please.   >> greetings to all of the respected and dignified people of iran. i extend condolences on the demise of the late ali khamenei and wish every irani and prosperity. >> thank you very much. >> greetings to all the viewers and i'm happy that once again through the tv i am talking to you and i would like to the kunkel club departure of alikhamenei. we all share dignity to khamenei and wish you the best. >> thank you very much. >> well, let me provide a comment at the outset. each one of you will have ten minutes to present your comments, so i will keep track of time and allocate 41 or 42   minutes. actually mr. mahmoud ahmadinejad is going to start. mr. mir-hossein mousavi, you will speak for the conclusion. mr. muller ahmadinejad, basically every person may have independent or social concerns. so, if you want -- since you arethe presidential candidate and you are competing presidential race, what are your main concerns for running for the presidency? >> in the name of god, the passionate and the merciful,   initially i thank god almighty to gave me the opportunity to serve the great nation of iran for one term and i also appreciate the nation for all their support and their backing for me. and i hope that the iranians nation will always keep its dignity. we remember the late leader ofthe islamic revolution and the martyrs' and to whom we owe all we have nowadays. elections i guess is a making a pair iraq. it isn't only picking one single person, it also means people getting energized for taking leaps towards conquering peaks of success and development. the atmosphere, the vote should   be one of fervent zeal and excitement. it should be replete with logic friendship and convergence and brotherhood. at the beginning, i would like to make some complaints about some unfair, let's call it cruel attitude and approach is in great why -- lies and sat atollsand against the government. in the previous revolution we never had this to be it in the term of one's symbol government or the course of an election, we never saw heavy attack with criticism launched against any government. i think the reason is the friends who decided to enter the stage felt maybe they could never compete with this government and any other   construct especially in the field of excellence of services of the government which is unprecedented. any we enter, they also render valuable services, but the function of the government and performance of this government has been tantamount to the performance of several governments. on the international level, unfortunately great success of the people have been ignored. the services of the governmentwere totally eight milward. i wish they would instead of launching this propaganda i wish they would put forward a plan. in the campaign on fortunately the great people of iran were in -- insulted. why she would disappoint people with ourselves?   why should we be so infatuated with power? i personally am not keen on charging such issues. for years i tolerated of those. all these insults directed to me myself i forgive it all and i still like to forgive on this. i announced it several times, but i cannot allow people to be insulted and people's shlaes andactually people's understanding. this i cannot let go. people do not allow me to take it easy when their dignity is being insulted and in my meetings with people in various cities extensively come and ask me to go to their defense and defend their positions.   the root of these misdemeanors and lies and deceptions should be publicized. already promised people to let them know what is happening and i think today mir-hossein mousavi is not sitting in front of me, it is not mr. mir-hossein mousavi alone, it is three consecutive governments in front of me facing me. it's mr. mousavi, mr. khatami.he served in previous term. as a matter of fact, these people have always been bringing forces together and they've been attacking this government, criticizing this government trying to hurt this government. of course people know all about this, but they should also   realize the fact that i am not standing, i am not competing one single candidate, it is a group of people with mr. mousavi of access and cooperating and moving against me. the reason for this heavy pressure on me the past four years and also heavier pressure during the election days, ithink this comes down to one thing. in the past three governments the administrative structures were formed some managerial chains were formed and they went awry. they distanced themselves from the revolution. i don't mean that military services in europe rendered, but gradually, there was a current that came in and acted as if   they were as if they possessed and they manipulate it and they had an open hand and doing everything they wanted to do. they stood in front of me, but people defeated them. the past four years they tried to render this government on successful and tried to crush it but with the blessing of god almighty and the support of the people so far we have tried thepath, we are here now in the previous election from inside my rifle received backing and support. at the beginning of this very government, mr. khamenei sent to the states and told them not to be worried that within six months this government will collapse and later on some people gave explanations and   that story came to an end. this clearly means planning, extensive planning against this government as this government has been only serving people in the short period of four years it has achieved a great honor domestically and internationally versus the job of the people themselves. you can see their capacities areflourishing in science and technology and politics especially in foreign policy the people of iran are being respected, among the most respected nations in the world but all of these are being ignored and the greatest lies and insults in the four years especially the last three months have come our way. first i like mr. mousavi and   always have respected him, but what has been happening the past three months, this is not justified for me. if we want to realize there are problems in this country, we do not have to necessarily have another actor that there is actually addiction and the course of the troops across the country you realize there areproblems but are these all created the past four years? what about the 24 years before that? and does it mean that there was a have -- have an antiutopia and delivered to me and i turned it out of -- i turned to hell and nothing positive has been done? recently we have employment. you just visited four or five provinces. i have seen the whole country   from -- if i'm going to talk about problems people have i should spend all of this session to talk about those problems. still we will be short of time. have you just realized we have problems? we have no unemployment before, no addiction before? no factories, agricultural problems? no issues, industrial problems? all of them relate to this government?i wish you had offered a plan. one more sentence, one more statement. i was kidding somewhere i said as a joke is on on lucky i am also a candidate and asked the three other candidates what would they have to take people and i shall also add during the electoral campaign there is no competition between four people, there are three people against one. whenever they say, even the debate last night it wasn't a debate at all, it was all   against one person. i think this is a logical, it holds no water and i wish to work on justice. >> thank you. mr. mir-hossein mousavi. >> in the name of god, the compassionate and the merciful i would like to thank all of the viewers and very good points were made, when to discuss them and give answers in amethodological answer. first of all, i really wish mr. mahmoud ahmadinejad succeeded in his endeavors and i would fancher on schappell problems. if i had the connection, it definitely i would make necessary not to enter the race. i will make a few points and then talk about the main points.   mr. khatami and khamenei are great figures and have to put this debate in the debate with mr. mahmoud ahmadinejad and get answer to his points. i answer the race because i feel the danger in fact i am on gwen to touch of the area of mr. khatami. during the four years he is talking about when i was in power during the lifetime of alikhamenei and if necessary get answer to his plans. i've always loved iran and i think this lot is inherent in all of us. i cannot find any iranian not to be honored to be an iranian who wasn't concerned that the future of iran or the difficulties and problems. we want to create an dayron that   is prosperous. the revolution was in fact launched in order to have a great islamic iran and influential iran to be able to lead the pack to and important message to the world but in solving the problems of thecountry and in order to achieve the proper place i think there are two ways there can be to managements in this regard. one is on the basis of adventurism and instability and raising the slogans, imaginative moves and also superstition on the basis of selfishness,   self-centered miss and not abiding by the rule of law and also on the basis of going to the extremes i am going to forward my discussion on the basis of this framework. okay, another method is logical and professional moves away from superstition and also on the basis of faithfulness and relying on the wisdom and being futuristic and also on the basis of moderation.if we want to have a powerful iran, i think that the second method is more suitable. we have to move on the basis of the second methodology. indeed, she talked about plans and i have written my plans and programs and i think i have three debates people like to   just watch and i think that debates are complementary to each other contrary to mr. mahmoud on initial's severe point because i offer my view points. what is most important in this debate is the main incentive for me to enter the race. as a matter of fact, i am concerned about the future of the country because the present management of the country, and since you started about theforeign policy let me touch the foreign policy first and then the economic and social efforts. often main problems we are facing are discussed case by case and tangible for all. i am not going to just talk in general terms. i will give examples. one of the problems is in come come compatibility.   these slogans are rare indeed but when we say that a country is collapsing and we are going to manage the world these are slogans and there is no practical backing. let me give you an example, a few examples in deed. the release of the britishinvaded or encroach upon a rally in waters and for the rest of them it was a great job and should be acknowledged indeed. but immediately on the basis of the framework i mentioned that we have to execute them. why have they encroached upon iran and ayatollah and then we decided to give them the suits to wear and then our president who doesn't belong to himself,   it belongs to you and then he went and sold them off and said goodbye to them and then our arranged a ceremony that we don't even organize for the heads of other countries, and did a really preserve the dignity of the nation? i don't think so. it inflicted the laws and undermine the dignity of the iranian nation and created someof the stand-downs' from the policy and we cannot solve our problems. and then the head of the government had a trip to iraq. we don't clarify them how -- he said they are going to kidnap me. so if they are going to kidnap you, probably the americans should kidnap you.   the americans in fact provided the field of the airplane that you traveled with. and then in iraq we went controlled by americans and you had the meeting over there and then we have the american soldiers and the same event happened and you said you were going to kidnap costs, social weexpand our imaginations to the extent it would just influence the foreign policy which is a realm of the national interest, should we solve our problems or create some problems so that it inflicts less on us? and then the issue of saudi arabia. i have heard from others and it has been a number of times in   the past i was in power, it is important how we are invited to other countries and then we get the message to them to invite us to go to saudi arabia and then fled friends in the foreign ministry have said and i quote them regarding our demand for being invited to go to saudi arabia and when we go -- one ofthe results is the situation our patrons face with saudi arabia and then quoting the head of that country, we talked something against the foreign minister of that country and created some problems in our relations. why should we impose this cost to those who are going to pay   and those who are heavy or not. and then a number of times we have heard that and believe the united states is collapsing. if it is so why have we troubled therefore times? blight continuously we are after and a specific manner the swiss president has gone there andspoke in the parliament and i think he wouldn't take the risk to life was saying he has been given a message to obama to talk before the elections to some house of the relations between the two countries. is it an interest in our country? alladi in the emirate and get the headlines only because you started from foreign policy and foreign policy indeed we have undermined if the dignity of the   nation and our country and it inflicted heavy damage and we've created problems for our development and tension with other countries. >> only one more minute and then you can count it at the end. >> well, your time is actually over. >> i will be very brief the holocaust is another issue --and then again you know that international organizations and security council [inaudible] what happened when i watched like couldn't believe our presidential be treated in this manner because he is the symbol of our country and i will later   talk about the prestige and the dignity of the iranian nation and then they announced it, was it a resolution and then the relationship between europe and israel deteriorated because of gauze","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 4, 2009 7:00pm-7:30pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

on this bill and the functions of the f.d.a. concerning the importation of prescription drugs into this country. i believe the senator from north dakota's amendment and i would agree to a time agreement within an hour -- hour equally divided or half-hour equally divided and vote on it. but i think the american people ought to know whether we're going to be able to import prescription drugs into this country so to save them billions of dollars every year rather   than take so much of their hard-earned money, especially retirees. mr. reid: madam president? the presiding officer: the majority leader. mr. reid: w we have been trying for two days to move forward on germane amendments. i have had several conversations with senator dorgan. i know how important he feels. i voted with him and you every time this matter has come up. and i would be happy, ace indicated here earlier, to work out some kind of an agreement onthis. but at this time, until we get some ability to vote on the germane amendments, it just doesn't seem like the right thing to do. i'm willing, as i've indicated to my friend, senator dorgan, to work out some arrangement for him to offer this amendment. this is something that should have been done, i'm sorry to say, years ago, not weeks ago. and so i will work with the distinguished senator from arizona on this drug reimpure takers which is important.   but at this stage we just simply can't -- i know of no way to get from here to there. but as i did say -- and the manager of this bill is here -- if we can work something out over the next -- by monday, i'm happy to try to work something out. no one is trying to stop you from offering this amendment. we just have to have some agreement to move forward on the other stuff first. they're germane. mr. mccain: well, let me say to the majority leader -- mr. reid: i have the floor,madam president. mr. mccain: would the senator yield? mr. reid: yes, without losing the floor, i would be happy to sure. mr. mccain: i would say, i am very aappreciative of the difficulties that he neighs on a bill of this nature and the challenges that -- of amendments and nongermane and also it's -- the difficulties that he faces in managing legislation. this issue has been around for a long time. could i say to my friend from   nevada, it's been around for a long time. we should address it. it is important to the american people. it really does have a lot to do with the -- with the pharmaceuticals in this country and i availability. and i would point out -- and its availability. and i would point out again to the distinguished majority leader, there shouldn't be a lot of debate on this. i mean, people have taken their positions. but i also know that farm -- and i have an -- but i also knowthat pharma -- and i also know that i have an e-mail that was sent, from pharma, to not have a debate and vote on it. if my friend would indulge me, it is an important -- ""urgent."" this is from

the other new jersey companies coordinate and contact senator men nen des aves and get him to take the lead? we're trying to get senator dorgan to back down. senator mccain has said hewill offer

little insight as to how the special interests in   washington work. and i really would like to have an amendment -- a vote on this amendment, i say to my friend from nevada, with full appreciation of the difficulties that he has in getting this legislation through, a very important piece of legislation. i thank my friend from nevada for his indulgence in allowing me to read that e-mail. thank you. mr. reid: madam president, that is really kind of insight. i don't know who's on first, butit is pretty interesting. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer: the clerk will call the roll. quorum call:the presiding officer: the majority leader. mr. reid: i ask unanimous consent that the call of the   quorum be terminated. the presiding officer: without objection. mr. reid: i now dishact we proceed to a period of morning business with senators allowed to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. the presiding officer: without objection. mr. reid: madam president, as if in -- well, first of all, i ask unanimous consent the senate proceed to executive session to consider calendar number 132, the nomination of william sessions to be the chair of the united states sentencing commission. the presiding officer: is there objection? mr. mcconnell: madampresident, we have not had an opportunity to get that cleared on this side as yet. so, therefore, i will have to object for the moment. the presiding officer: objection is heard. mr. reid: madam president, i ask unanimous consent the senate proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of robert groves to be director of the census. the presiding officer: is there objection? mr. mcconnell: madam president, i would make the same observation with regard to this nominee. we have not yet been able to get it cleared on this side. therefore, i object.   the presiding officer: the objection is heard. mr. reid: madam president, for the -- we've been getting inquiries in the cloakroom -- cloakrooms, plural. there will be no more votes today. i indicated today we would be out by 6 anyway. there are a number of things going on. we will work on a number of issues over the weekend, including the tobacco issue and other things, and we will vote on monday at 5:30 on the cloturemotions that we filed earlier this afternoon. no more votes today, tomorrow, not monday until 5:30. mr. dodd: madam president? the presiding officer: the senator from connecticut. mr. dodd: madam president, i listened carefully to the conversation between the majority leader and our friend and colleague from arizona. i just want to, as the manager of this bill on smoking, let me say, i for one have also been a strong advocate for the reimportation proposal that   senator mccain and dorgan among others have expressed an interest in. i think most of my colleagues have expressed their views on this and i suspect a majority have expressed their support for the idea. this is not about deny ago vote on reimpure taismghts i think we'd also take that opportunity. this bill on smoking and children is about as fragile a proposal that i've seen here in a long time. there are strong voices that would like to kill this legislation and have effectively. the food and drug administrationhas jurisdiction over almost every product you can think of except tobacco, including pet food. we've wasted ten years trying to get to this bill. you lose one or two votes on this bill here, you lose this bill again, and we're back where we were for the last decade. and so there will be any number of very attractive ideas proposed to this legislation, many of which i've either supported or would like to support. but with the full knowledge in doing so, i run the risk of breaking up that necessary 60   votes to deal with children and smoking. so no matter how appealing some of these amendments may be, understand what you may be doing, and that is destroying the ability to deal with the 3,000 to 4,000 kids who start smoking every day and the 400,000 people who die every year. so i want a vote on reapportionment as well. i want to vote on a lot of issues here. but every time we bring up a bill of this significance and someone offers a very appealing proposal, understand that the danger is you fracture thatrelationship that has denied us the opportunity to pass this bill for a decade, despite the fact that both bodies have voted overwhelmingly but not in the same congress and we're on the brink of getting this done. and what better thing could we accomplish on the each of the health care debate than to start saving the lives of children. i've got 76,000 kids in connecticut that are going to die because they're smokers. 76,000 of them. there are 6 million children today who are going to die prematurely because of smoking. now, as much as i wanted to deal   with a rhee portionment -- or, -- reapportionment -- or, what do you call it? -- reimportation of drugs, and if we do that and it is adopted and we lose the coalition on smoking, what have we achieved? the bill dies. you lose both reimportation as wellals the smoking proposal. i appreciate the majority leader taking the position. i know where he stands on the issue. harry reid has been a strong advocate of reimportation. that's not the issue here.the issue is whether or not, at long last, a decade later our colleague from massachusetts, senator kennedy, mite, mike dewine, our former colleague from ohio, henry waxman from california, tom davis of virginia in a bipartisan basis have tried year in and year out to get this done. we haven't been able to achieve it. so i know the game. but this is not a game. this is life and death with people. for 10 long years we've.   mr. bennet: able to pass legislation -- mr. dodd: for 10 long years we've not been able to pass this legislation. if people are going to insist on long-term amendments based 0 on a short-term appeal, we will have done great damage. so i appreciate immensely the position the majority leader has taken. and my colleagues know because i did go through the process last week in our committee. there are any number of appealing amendments. and i want to thank the members of the committee who wanted to vote for some of those amendments. i see my good friend jeffmerkley from oregon here, a member of the committee. there are a number of amendments that he and i would have liked to have supported including daicial penalties and fines. but we know full well if we did that, we might break that fragile coalition of getting us to the goal line of passing this. so i for one want to stand here and say thank you to the majority leader for standing up on an issue that he cares deeply boxer the reimportation of drugs, because he understands, as does the presiding officer, as do all of us here who have   loved ones we've cared about who've been smokers, who've a effected by tobacco and the harm and department of justice it does to our -- and the harm and damage it does to our citizenry, it is the only disease that's self-inflicted. there are more deaths each year as a result of smoking and tobacco products than alcohol, drugs, suicide, aids combined, automobile accidents. it's the greatest killer in america. and we have a dhans to make a difference on it. the day will come for reimportation. we ought to get to it. but if you do it on this bill, understand you lose both --reimportation and the smoking bill. that's the danger. i thank the majority leader. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer: the clerk will call the roll. quorum call:quorum call:the presiding officer: the senator from delaware. mr. kaufman: i ask unanimous consent the call of the quorum be dispensed. .the presiding officer: without objection, so ordered. mr. kaufman: madam president, i would like to ton where i began by honoring the contribution of our federal employees. on may 4 i came to the floor to discuss the importance of recognizing the hard work and dedicated service of our federal employees. this is especially important because our recovery acts during cheese challenging economic   times. the programs we enact, it is easy to say, will be carried out by a federal workforce that requires people's confidence. i know from personal experience how industrious our civil certificate e.p.a.s are. -- civil servants are. we need to encourage graduates to enter a career in federal service. we need them to lend their talents and their ideas, theircreative minds. this is why i make it a priority to call attention to what federal employees can and do accomplish. in my previous remarks i promised it highlight excellent public servants from this desk every so often. in keeping with my promise i rise today to speak about two federal employees whose achievements are particularly relevant to our work here in this session: the current state of our health care system. as many know, cervical cancer is   the second most common cause of cancer death in women worldwide. it takes the lives of almost 250,000 women each year. here in america, nearly 11,000 women are diagnosed annually. what distinguishes cervical cancer from other cancers is the cause. while many cancers are linked to a genetic predisposition for abnormal cell growth nearly all of these result from viral infections. the majority of the infectionscome from exposure to the h.p.v. which is most common sexually transmitted disease affecting americans. when doctor douglas lowy and john shiller began studying h.p.v. little did they know their 20 year partnership would lead to the development of vaccine. working at the national institute of center for cancer research, the two discovered that previous attempts at creating a vaccine had failed   because of genetic my taiption n existed in the virus. when the doctors made this finding they worked to create a modified version of the h.p.v. without the mutation. this development was instrumental in the creation a few years ago of a evacuation seen to prevent the vast majority of the cases from developing. because over 80% of those that develop cervical cases live indeveloping nations the doctors have been working with the world health organization to make the h.p.v. vaccine available to women around the world. in recognition of their achievement the two were awarded the 2007 service to america federal employee of the year medicals. today women and girls able nine through 26 have the ability to be vaccinated against developing cervical cancer. once again, i call on my tell low senators to join me and honor dr. lowy and dr. shiller   and all federal employees who distinguish themselves in the service of our nation. madam president, i would like to speak on reforming our health care system. simply put: health care reform has been delayed for far too long and it cannot wait any longer. most americans are satisfied with the health care they receive. let me repeat this: most americans are satisfied with thehealth care they receive today. but if we want to sustain and improve the quality of health care we need to act now. what their concerned about is what the future health care will be about. and also concerned about the cost of health care. we must get health care costs under control while preserving choice. if we do nothing, and allow the status quo to persist it is estimated that the share of gross domestic product devoted to health care will rice from 18% in 2009 to 28% in 2030.   if health care premiums continue to rise at 4% per year, which is actually less than the historical average, that by 2025, premiums for family coverage will reach $25,200 per year, over 2,000 a month! this is simply unsustainable. we have attempted to reform our health care system several times in the past to no avail. but this year is different andhas got to be different. this time, the call for reform is coming from people and organizations that previously opposed reform. this time, businesses along with unions that represent their workers are asking for reform. business in america have to compete against companies from other countries. many do not pay anything for health care for their workers or retirees and others pay far less than what man of our larger corporations pay. this puts many of our businesses at a disadvantage in the global   marketplace. in addition, people in my home state of delaware and americans across the nation are struggling to keep up with the crushing and seemingly constant increase in the cost of health care. offer the last decade, americans have watched as the health insurance premiums deductibles have risen at faster rates than raises threatening their financial stability. it also puts them at risk for losing their insurance as employers struggle to provide adequate health care coverage. americans, rightfully, valuetheir relationship with their doctor and the care they receive. we must, and i say must, preserve these relationships. in addition, as costs rise and insurance benefits erode americans are asking for reform -- to reform what is broken. our current system, the status quo, is rampant with bureaucracy, inefficiency, and waste. it is time for reform. it's time to reform health care for americans so that everyone   has access to quality, affordable care, regardless of preexisting medical condition. it is time to reform health care to replace a higher priority on prevention and wellness saving lives and money. it is time to reform health care so all americans can compare the cost and benefits of different health care policy. it is time to reform health care so americans have more choices, not less, and can choose their own doctor. i applaud the members of thefinance committee and the health education labor and pensions committee here in the senate as well as our counterparts in the house for this sincere dedication, thoroughness and commitment to crafting legislation that truly transformed the health care system in this country. it is clear this is not an easy tack. and it is one that requires true compromise from everyone across the ideological spectrum but it is a task that must be done. our country and the health of   its citizens and the economy cannot afford to maintain the status quo. as a member of these committees gather to discuss and markup legislation, i encourage them to include a viable public option and a menu of insurance options from which americans may choose. it would be a, i stress, a purely voluntary option. if you like your current plan, keep it. but a public health insurance option is critical to ensure the greatest amount of choicepossible for consumers. there are too many americans that do not have real choices when it comes to health insurance, especially those who live in rural areas. in addition, many large urban areas dominated by one or two insurers that seven more than 60% of the market. in fact, there are seven states where one insurer has only 75% of the market share. a public auction can -- option   can help americans expand their choice of provider. a public option could take various forms and i think the committees are the proper place to determine the appropriate contours of public option. but i think a good starting point for discussion is the proposal put forward by my colleague from new york, senator schumer. it delivers all the benefits of increased competition without relying on unfair built in advantages for the federally-backed option. this public option would not be subsidized by the government orpartnered by medicare. it would not be supported by tax revenue and it would compete on a level playing field with the private insurance industry. and if a level playing field exists, then private insurers will have to compete based on quality of care and pricing instead of just competing for the healthiest consumes. this is just one proposal for a public option. there are others that we can debate as we move forward. right now, more than 30 state governments offer their employees a choice between   traditional private insurance and a plan that is self-insured by the state. some of them have them for more than 15 years. and these states -- in these states the market share of the self-plunded plans range from -- self-funded plans range from 25% to 50%, a healthy competition and not domination by either time of insure irand the states provide the options because it adds values to the competitiveofferings of the workers and they do not seem to be a problem at the private level. why should it be so on a national level? a public option goes a long way to introducing quality advancements and innovation that many do not now have the incentive to implement privately. medicare and the veterans health system have spearheaded important innovations in the past including payment methods, quality of care initiatives, and   nferlings technology advancements -- information technology advancements and this could lead the way in bringing more innovation to delivery system and introducing new measures to reduce costs and improve quality. a public option serves as a benchmark for all insurers setting a standard for costs, quality, and access within regional or national marketplaces. it can have low administrative costs and have a broad choice for providers. simply put, americans","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 4, 2009 5:30pm-6:00pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

private plans. a public option will give americans a better change of chases and keep insurance companies honest. the key to all of this, however, is that a public option will be just that. as i said before, an option, not a phab date. some people would choose it -- not a mandate. some people will choose it. others will not. if you like the insurance plan you have now, you keep it.   if you're happy with the insurance you get from your employer or the individual insurance market, or you may be he be rolled, stay enrolled in that insurance plan. if you're unsatisfied with the public option, you have the option to switch back to private insurers. americans firmly support the ability to choose their own doctor and value their relationship with the providers, and so do i. an overriding goal of health reform is to increase patients access to affordable, quality health care and offering publicoption can help increase america's choices. i am heartened that i was joined by 26 other senators several weeks ago in cosponsoring a resolution sponsored by senator brown calling for the inclusion of the federally backed health insurance option and health care reform. senators have been involved in health care issues for decades: senators kennedy, dodd, rockefeller, bingaman, just to name a few have all agreed a public option should be included. as i said before, i admire the efforts of my colleagues on   finance and health, education, labor and pension committee who will be drafting our health reform legislation. they have an important responsibility, and i recognize they will be debating many, many options regarding coverage, financing, regulations and so object. i simply encourage that to consider seriously a public option as a choice for americans in any new health insurance exchange. thank you, mr. president. i yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer: theclerk will call the roll. quorum call:the presiding officer: the senator from vermont. mr. sanders: mr. president, i   ask unanimous consent that privileges of the floor be granted to a fellow in my office. the presiding officer: the senate is in a quorum call. mr. sanders: i ask that the quorum call be vitiated. the presiding officer: without objection. mr. sanders: -- consent that the privileges of the floor be granted to a fellow in my office, gail henson. the presiding officer: without objection. mr. sanders: mr. president, i think the american people are aware that our country is in the midst of a major health carecrisis. that's not a secret to anybody. 46 million americans have no health insurance. and importantly, even more are underinsured with high deductibles and copayments. further, some 60 million americans, including many with health insurance, do not have access to a medical home of their own. in fact, according to the institute of medicine, some 18,000 americans die each year from preventible diseases   because they lack health insurance and do not get to a doctor when they should. and i can recall very vividly talking to several physicians in vermont who told me how people walked into their office quite sick, and when they asked why didn't you come in earlier, they said, well, we don't have a lot of money. we didn't have any health insurance. and the result is that those patients die. that happens every single day in this great country. and then when we talk about health care, we have tounderstand that access to dental care is even worse. and then on top of that, in our nation we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. my state of vermont borders on canada, and it is not uncommon for people to be going from vermont to canada to buy the prescription drugs that they need at far lower cost than in america. and in the midst of all of this,   of 46 million americans without health insurance, people being underinsured, people paying outagesly high costs for prescription drugs, at the end of the day our nation pays far more for health care per person than any other country on earth. far more. not even close. and yet, despite the enormous sum of money we spend, our health care outcomes, what we get for what we spend lags behind many other countries interms of life expectancy -- how long our people live -- in terms of infant mortality and other health indices. according to a recent report from the national center for health statistics, for example, one example: the united states ranks in infant mortality 29th in the world. 29th in the world. we are tied with poland and slovakia. we're 29th in the world in   terms of infant mortality, in all due respect, to our friends in poland and slovakia. we should be doing a lot better than that, because we spend a lot more on health care than they do in poland and slovakia. further, according to a study published in the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, the united states has the highest rate of preventible deaths among 19 industrialized nations.and although our rate has declined over the past five years, it is doing so at a slower rate than other countries. according to that study, if the rate of preventible deaths in the united states improved to the average of the top three countries -- france, japan, and australia -- approximately 100,000 fewer u.s. residents would die annually. mr. president, when we talk about health care, we're not just talking about individuals   who suffer and die because they don't have health care. what we're talking about is that the high cost of health care, as president obama makes clear all of the time, is a major, major economic issue as well. in our country today, we are now spending about 16% of our g.n.p. on health care. and the cost of health care is continuing to rise at a very high rate, which becomeseconomically unsustainable. the fact of the matter is that general motors, which recently declared bankruptcy, spends more money on health care per automobile than they do on steel. and that creates an economic climate in which america, our companies, become noncompetitive with other countries around the world. but it's not just large corporations like g.m. small business owners in vermont and throughout this country are   finding it harder and harder not only to provide health care for their workers, but even for themselves. in addition, a recent study found that medical problems contributed to 62% of all bankruptcies in 2007 and that between 2001 and 2007, the proportion of all bankruptcies attributable to medical problemsrose by nearly 50%. and interestingly 78% of those experience bankruptcy as a result of illness were insured. they were insured. this is not people did not have any health insurance, but it speaks to the inadequacy and the lack of coverage, comprehensive coverage in many health insurance programs. mr. president, we really as a   congress, for whatever reason -- and i'll suggest the reason in a moment -- don't really spend a lot of time really discussing why the american health care system is so expensive, why it is so inefficient, why it is so complicated. we don't talk about that very much. and i fear that that has a lot to do with the role that private health insurance have and playover the political process in this country. so let me be very clear. in my view, the evidence, the evidence is overwhelming that the function of a private health insurance company is not to provide health care. the functions of a private health insurance company is to make as much money as it possibly can. and the truth is the more health   care a private health insurance company denies people, the more money it makes. so if you submit a claim for coverage and they deny it, from their perspective, that is a very good thing because they make more money. further, in pursuit of making as much money as they can, private health insurance companies have created a patchwork system whichis the most complicated, the most bureaucratic and the most wasteful in the world. and according to a number of studies, we always think about $4 -- we are wasting about $400 billion a year in administrative costs, profiteering and bureaucratic billing practice, and that is enough money to provide health care to all of the uninsured. now i know that that's not an issue we're supposed to be   talking about here on the floor of the senate, because we're not supposed to take on the insurance companies or the drug companies because of all of their power. but i think if we are serious about moving toward a universal comprehensive, cost-effective health care system in this country we have got to talk about the very negative role that private health insurance companies are playing in thatprocess. administrative costs for insurers, employers, and the providers of health care in the united states are about one out of every four health care dollars that we spend. in other words, for every dollar that we spend, one-quarter of that dollar does not go to doctors, does not go to nurses, does not go to medicine, does not go to therapies. it goes to administration. and that is at the root of the problem that we have in terms of   health care costs in america. in pursuit of making administrative in california -- one example: in california, only 66% of total insurance premiums are used to cover hospital and physician services. one-third, one out of every three dollars is spent on administration, billing, claims processing, sales and marketing,finance and underwriting. mr. president, the american people want their health care dollars spent on health care. i know that's a radical idea. but when people spend money on health care, they assume that it goes to the provision of health care, not profiteering, not administration, not hiring more bureaucrats to tell us that we're not covered when we thought we were covered. the american people want as close to that dollar, 100 cents   on that dollar to go to health care and not bureaucracy. while health care costs in america have soared, as everybody knows, from 2003 to 2007, the combined profits of the nation's major health insurance companies increased by 170%. health care costs are soaring. the profits of the major health insurance companies have gone up by 170% from 2003 to 2007.and c.e.o. compensation for the top seven health insurance companies averaged over $14 million per c.e.o. mr. president, to add insult to injury, some of these health care profits are going directly into campaign contributions and into lobbying to make sure in fact that congress does not move   forward toward real health care reform which, in my view, means a single-payer health care system. so, mr. president, that's where we are at right now. we have the most inefficient, wasteful bureaucratic system of any major country on earth. our health care outcomes, despite all the money we spend, are way below many other countries in the world and we are not discussing the mostimportant issue with regard to health care spending, and that is the role that private health insurance companies are playing. so, mr. president, we are now in the beginning of the debate on health care and i'm going to do my best to make sure that that issue of the role that private health insurance companies are playing in the system, the very negative role they're playing is something that, in fact, we talk about. and with that, mr. president, i   yield the floor. a senator: mr. president? the presiding officer: the senator from ohio. mr. brown: thank you, mr. president. i commend my friend, the senator from -- the junior senator from vermont for his words about this critique of the health insurance system. you know, what's right about it and what's wrong with it, we know that for those with insurance, we can get good medical care in this country we know that many people don't have any insurance.we know that many others have inadequate insurance, and we know that so many americans are in a situation where they're just anxious about the future of their -- of their health -- the future of the quality of health care that they -- that they have. too many americans have seen their health care premiums go up, their deductibles go up, their co-pays go up. they end up with a private insurance company that finds ways to delay paying them, to,   in many cases, to not reimburse them at all for their health care insurance. it is insurance that doesn't really deliver. that is really no insurance at all. what senator sanders said is exactly right, the behavior of health insurance companies have mentd that we have huge anyone -- meant that we have huge administrative costs. we remember what the president of the united states said when he was a candidate for president, senate sanders mentioned that to president obama, how moved people in this country were when they heardabout the president talk about his own mother who was dying who was fighting with insurance companies over paying for her cancer treatment while she was dying. and she had to advocate for herself, her son was advocating for her too. but thee went through the trauma and pain of cancer and the trauma and pain of dealing with insurance companies. we know that. yet, some in this body want to increase the role of private insurance and allow them to continue to gain the system.   we also know that private insurance companies, in many ways, are simply a step ahead of the sheriff. that they will ensure -- that they don't mind insurancing someone who is 50 and healthy, but they would rather not insurance someone who is 63 and healthy. someone who is has a preexisting continue they will find a way to not insurance them or not pay off to them when that person gets sick. we know about the inefficiencyof the health care system, we know about the inefficiency of the private insurance. we know about the difficulty of the private insurance and the administrative cost of private industry. the private administrative costs run from 15% to 30%, depending in you're in a big group plan or small are group plan or individual plan. we know that medical care, which is -- medicare, delivered for years, we know that medicare is   delivered very well in the great majority of cases for the american people, for the elderly, but we also know that medicare has a 2% or 3% administrative cost, again, contrast to the 15% to 30% with private insurance companies. interestingly, there was a statistic -- there was a study several years ago that medicare -- that of the major -- of the -- a study of the richestindustrial democracies, france, germany, japan, israel, italy, canada, and the united states. and they rated all of these countries according to several indices, life expectancy, faint mortality, the inoculation rates for the children. the united states ranked 12th. even though we spend twice as much as any other country on ert   per capita, our outcomes were not as good. we were 12th out of 30. one area that we -- if you get to be 65 in this country, the chances are you're going to live a longer, healthier life than almost any other country in the world. why? because we have a health care system, medicare that provides health insurance for everybodyover 65. there are polls and gaps in coverage in medicare, the premiums can be pretty hard for some to reach. the co-pay and deductible can be a problem. overall people know when they have medicare, they are pretty well darned taken care of and that is not the case for people under 65. i came it the floor tonight for a few more moments, mr. president, as i was listening to senator sanders talk so eloquently to share a couple of   stories. sherry in albany, ohio, she is not medicare eligible, she is forced to consider borrowing from the equity in her home to pay her $1,070 premium through cobra. she had a job. she lost her job. she has to pay the employer and employee side to pay for her health insurance. that's the way cobra works. a good program, but a bit of a cruel hoax, if you lose your job, it is pretty hard to pay your premium and your employer's premium at the same time.she's considering borrowing against her house to pay for her health insurance for cobra for 18 months, she will get a little bit of help now, because in the stimulus package, we took he care of some of that. she that's to find a way until 65 to cobble together insurance. terry, a small business owner nearby in columbus, expects to pay 35% more this year to cover his employees. he wants to cover his employees, but he has a 30% increase.   what's he supposed to do? especially when his business, i don't know a lot about his business, but so many small businesses are squeezed more and more because of the economy. so we know these stories, and that's why it's so important, mr. president, that we -- that we address health care reform this year. now, we want to do several things. first of all, anybody that's in a health care plan that they're happy with, that they're satisfied with now, they can stay in that plan. if they want to make that choice, they stay in the plan.second, we're going to do a lot of cost. we need to -- we need to stop the huge increase in premiums, co-pace, deductibles, we have to do a better job to constrain costs in the health care plan than this government or the private sector has been able to do for decades. third, we need to give people full choice. that means that they can stay in their plan, as i mentioned earlier, number one, but they also will have a choice of private insurance plans and a public plan, a public option, so   they can choose a private plan with aetna or a private plan with united health or a private plan with blue cross blue shield or they can decide to join a public plan, a public plan that might look like medicare, which they can decide, perhaps they would save money or better preventive care or a plan with lower co-pays or deduct ibles, they can -- deductibles. they can make the choice. a great majority of the democratic caucus, and i hoperepublicans will join us. an overwhelming sector wants that option a public plan and private plan that they can choose that might be similar to medicare. anything that we tried in health care, every time that health care reform was introduced, the across of government takeover and socialized medicine were heard by conservatives who don't think that government should have a role in health care. we're the only country in the world that -- that thinks that, it seems like, because every   other country they have a major part of their health care plan, a major, major part is involved with the government, if not the whole plan. we're not asking for a government takeover. we're not doing socialized medicine. that's what they always say. we heard in 1948 when harry truman tried to -- tried to push through medicare. we heard it in 1965, when lyndon johnson and the overwhelmingly democratic house and senate passed the medicare law we heard it in 1993, my first term in thehouse, senator sanders' second term in the house. that's what insurers are claiming today. they're saying government takeover of medicine. that's not true. we want a government option plan. we want the government to provide a medicare plan that people can choose from. you can choose a private plan or public plan. americans deserve no less. our country can afford no less. the president asked us to move on this as quickly as we can and   to do it right. this is our chance and i think we're going to do it. mr. sanders: will the senator from ohio yield for a moment? mr. brown: yes. mr. sanders: i want to thank him for his cogent remarks talking about one of the most basic issues facing this country, and that is health care. we're on the veterans committee as well, and i know that you spend a lot of time talking to veterans in ohio. you have heard a veteran in ohiotell you that they want to privatize the v.a.? mr. brown: i have heard mostly conservative republicans say that they want to privatize the v.a. mr. sanders: every time that issue is raised, the veterans say no. mr. brown: senator sanders, one of the things that we noticed about the veterans administration, is that the v.a. has found a way to -- to buy at the lowest cost possible some of the least expensive, but   good-quality prescription drugs. because what the v.a. does is there are millions of veterans, they negotiate on behalf of veterans with individual drug companies for individual prescription drugs, individual pharmaceuticals, and they get a rate at about one half of what you would pay if you went to drug part or rite aid or any of -- drug part or rite aid or any of the other stores.the medicare bill when it came through the house and senate, president bush pushed that bill. they didn't allow us to negotiate drug prices. we know what this is about. we know if we fl the lead of the drug industry and the insurance industry, which this congress did through most of the first part of this decade with president bush, we end up with -- with special interest laws that protect the drug companies or insurance companies. or we can now pass health care   with a public option plan give the public the option of going to a medicare-like plan instead of a private insurance company plan if they want to or stay in the plan that they're in and then they decide on what kind of care they would like. mr. sanders: my friend from ohio is exactly right. if you talk it the people of this country, if you talk to the veterans and say, do you want v.a. health care to be privatized, overwhelmingly, no.in recent years the senator from ohio, i and others worked to substantially increase funding for federally qualified community health care centers all over this country. these are the most cost-effective ways of providing quality health care, dental care, low-cost prescription drugs, mental health counseling. people of this country want those. i hope that we have success in expanding that program. but i get a little bit tired of hearing from some of our friends on the other side who tell us, oh, people don't want government   involved in health care, well, you tell that to seniors, tell them you want to privatize medicare, tell that to the veterans that you want to privatize the v.a. the fact of the matter is as the senator from ohio just indicated, we are wasting tens and tens of billions of dollars every year in bureaucracy, in billing, in excessive c.e.o. salaries through private health insurance companies. and at the very least -- at the very least, the people of this country are demanding panned wemust bring forth a strong -- are demanding and we must bring forth a strong, underline strong, public option within any health care reform program that we develop. mr. brown: i thank the senator from vermont. and it's pretty clear and i think this congress is going to do the right thing. the president when he met with us last week, as he promised in this campaign, was strongly if may never of purchasing insurance from the medicare look-alike plan or private plans   or either one or keeping what they already have. the president has spoken strongly on it for months, the majority of this congress wants to do the same and i'm hopeful that is what we do in the months ahead. i yield the floor and i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer: the clerk will call the roll. quorum call:","[curator:

and clear: a clear policy statement from the administration and congress is absolutely critical in acknowledging that nuclear-powered generation will be a growing part of our nation's energy mix. investments in programs that support the nuclear industry's near term implementation needs are absolutely vital. that is the number one thing, mr. president, is getting the $50 billion loan guarantee so we   can get more of these people off the ground. they all see the long-term potential growth of nuclear and would like to invest in nuclear manufacturing but they need a clear commitment from the government before they make those investments. mr. president, i think these people are saying, what they are see saying is we need presidential leadership to acknowledge what most of us and the rest of the world already know: we can't get there from here without nuclear. we can't get there from here without nuclear.i am convinced that nuclear power is the only real alternative we have today to produce enough low-cost, reliable, clean energy to remove harmful pollutants from the air, prevent the harmful effects of global climate change and keep jobs from going overseas. the biggest challenge remains the financing, particularly in nonregulated states. the deepening global economic crisis is putting additional pressure on the nuclear industry. and on utilities.   today, we have, as i mentioned, the applications have come in but d.o.e. has 14 nuclear presents, a total project cost of $188 billion and loan guarantee requests up to $122 billion. so basically, what i'm saying is that unless we can get this $50 billion loan guarantee taken care of, it's going to call this progress that we've been making,bring it to a halt. a very important point that gets lost in this discussion is the fact that the loan guarantee program authorized under the energy policy act requires the borrowers to pay all the required fees including what is called a subsidy cost and, thus, there's no cost to the government. in other words, if they borrow $5 billion, you will have to come up with, i think, close to $1 billion in order to secure that so that if things don't go well on the loan we've got something to turn to.   subsidy cost is levied on each loan guarantee similar to a down payment on a mortgage in case of a dwrawlt. any potential defaults are covered by fees paid by the applicants. i have a copy of a recent m.i.t. study on the future of nuclear power. the authors include former clinton administration officials john deutch and erni yevmenrniedthey say to mitigate global warming we must reevaluate the role of nuclear power as part of the energy future of our country. i share the conclusions from this report which i believe fits rather nicely with the speech -- and i quote -- ""the current assistance program put into place by the 2005 energy policy act has not been effective and needs to be improved. the sober warning is that if more is not done, nuclear power   will diminish as a practical and timely auction for deployment at a scale that constitutes a material contribution to climate change risk mitigation."" mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to include this report in the record. the presiding officer: without objection, so ordered. mr. voinovich: another issue that has plagued the industry for decades is the u.s. government's fall to meet its commitment to assume responsibility for spent nuclear fuel. first, let's get the recordstraight: i've talked with many experts and policy people including secretary chu and n.r.c. chairman kline and they all assure me -- this is important everyone understands that -- that the current spent nuclear that's being stored today in dry casks and pools are safe, are safe, and are secure for at least 100 years. that's very important because folks are saying, well, you can't go forward with this   because we don't know what to do with the waste. well, we would like to do something more permanent than what we're doing but the fact of the matter is that with the dry casks that we have we're in good shape for at least 100 years. so the lack of a repository at yucca should not be something that would inhibit us from licensing new reactors. that being said, we must pursue a long-term solution now. if yucca is not going tomaterialize, we owe the american people a viable alternative. the 1982 nuclear waste policy act established a nuclear waste fund, a fee paid by utilities to create a fund to deal with nuclear waste and since its beginning it has collected $29 million. so everyone understands this: since that act went into effect we have collected $29 million from ratepayers in this country. unfortunately, the fund is on   budget and only about $9 billion was used to deal with waste. the rest of the $20 billion amounts to little more than an i.o.u. to ratepayers and even if the administration decided to proceed with yucca we don't have the money to build a repository. we spent the money on other things and we'll have to borrow over $20 billion to replenish the fund. and the federal courts have ruled in favor of utilities, something else that most peopleare not aware of, and, thus far, we have paid utilities $550 million in damages because we haven't come up with a permanent repository for nuclear waste. i'm sure if we keep going the way we are it's going to be in the billions. i recently met with secretary chu and he told me he will convene a blue ribbon panel to study alternatives to yucca. i believe this is just kicking   the can down the road for a couple of years. we have been studying this thing for more than four decades and we need to provide clear direction and certainty on this issue. the time for studying options is over. and the federal government must meet its legal obligation and start taking the spent fuels problem sooner rather than lar. if the administration is pulling the plug on yucca without","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 4,

>> yes, sir. thank you.i don't think it'll surprise anybody the answer is that it's our mobility systems that are suffering the most wear and tear because of the ways that they're used and the pace that they're used. so i asked my staff recently what are the top five items on wear and tear. that's our fixed wing, rotary wing aviation, it's our ground mobility fleet and the maritime   platform. we're simply flying more hours, we're driving more miles. we're spending more time on the water. and this is just at a pace beyond what we had predicted when those systems were procured. so we are refurbishing them more often. and we've been resourced adequately to do that. my concern looking ahead is simply that we sustain the levelof resources that will permit us to keep this equipment going as we look forward to some forces drawing down in iraq especially we don't see that happening for special operation forces at all. so as we've come to depend on some special funding means to keep this going we'll have to find a way to work that into our baseline budget in order to sustain this equipment over time. but on that point as we're drawing down our conventional   sources i know there are some challenges in terms of your staying there and the same numbers in terms of making sure that you continue to get the support equipment that you need 'cause a lot of that you get from the conventional forces in the field. how is that playing out? are you satisfied those concerns are being met or is there more to be done? >> i think it's playing out when he will recently we had service chief level talks with the commandant of the marine corps and the chief of staff of the army. they are in complete accord to what the challenges are andseeking ways together to resolve those. i think there is a broad understanding that whether it's a small force in an area or a large force in an area, you still need somebody to control the air space, operate the air fields, provide the quick reaction force, provide the medical support, do all the rest of it that it takes. to look after the force that is forward. and so we are helping them help us by doing the detailed analysis of exactly what it is   we think will have to be left behind by the forces to drawdown in order to sustain the activity that stays behind. so i think we're on a good track with that in our conversations with the services. >> all right. thanks. i apologize. >> can you tell us what the typical rotational cycles are of soft personnel particularly in centcom and how that may be affecting what you best feel like you can do with regard to keeping up with such a pace in terms of rotation of personnel.i know that's been an issue that's coming up in the broader context with our military but i want specifically want to be concerned with the special operation forces? >> yes, sir. the service components have sort of evolved into different rotational paces depending on the nature of the force, the type of equipment they used, the nature of the operations that they're conducting so it ranges from about 90 days on the short end for some of our aviators who   fly an awful lot of hours at night on night vision goggles who burn up their more allotted hires quickly and come back and need to reset. through about seven months for our special forces operational detachment a teams be the green berets who are at battalion level rotations at that pace and then it extends beyond that to one-year rotations for many of the people assigned at the higher headquarters in order to provide a campaign planningcontinuity to the effort at the more senior levels. the rate now is sustainable. our predictions about how long we could sustain it were wrong. we didn't think that we could sustain it at this pace this long but the forces proving resilient beyond our -- beyond our estimates. i think personally that we are at a about maximum rate that we can sustain.   but i think that we can sustain this rate. for some time longer. it has now become the new normal. it is the way we operate. people who are doing this have been doing it long enough to know that this is what it is they can expect to do. and our retention rate remains high and our recruiting remains healthy. so if the demand didn'tincrease, we're probably pretty okay. but what we see is an increasing demand for special operation forces and so we've got a growth plan in place to accommodate that. >> thank you. good to have you here. thank you, mr. chairman. >> thank you. mr. ellsworth is recognized for five minutes. >> thank you, mr. chairman. thank you, i apologize for being late. i had some hoosiers in the office who didn't want to let me go. if this question has been discussed just let me know and i'll move on to something else. could you talk, admiral, a   little bit about some of the interoperability between the agencies. if things are being done in the most efficient manner between the interagency cooperation, some of the challenges you might have faced, what's the best practice and, you know, what are our successes and what challenges are you facing in the meld there? >> yes, sir, we did address that at some level and what i said very quickly is it's better than it will ever been. it will get better. and we are now at the point where the structures that have evolved to provide the venuesfor these kinds of interactions to occur. now it's a matter of the people getting the knowledge of each each other's organizations and traditions and, frankly, languages in order to talk to the efficiency of it. the terms are certainly in the right direction. we are way ahead where we thought we may have just a couple of years ago. >> great. if you would this is totally unrelated, an area of particular interest for me.   discuss what you can about our attempts and our movement in the nonlethal field. where we are on that whether vehicle stops and personnel stops. i know that's not normally what would be discussed in the special ops and would be a valuable part in winning the hearts and mind if you wouldn't mind telling me where we are and what we need. >> we are all in favor of every applicable nonlethal technology. we understand as well as anybody, i think, that killing people is not the way to successin either iraq, afghanistan, or anywhere else that we work. and that a nonlethal effect that can then give you time to sort out the situation, sort out the people would be a great advantage on the battlefield. special operations is in favor of any feasible appropriate technology. our position, though, is that those technologies have a much broader application than special   operations forces so we are advocates of it. we are champions for it. and we are cheerleaders for it but we have very few programs initiated within the special operations budget itself. >> i've seen some of the things -- i'm embarrassed being in in congress and seeing the armed services and i'm watching the discovery challenge and seeing the new technology about the heat, i guess, projecting apparatus. i don't even know what to callit. but it's very interesting -- is that on the edge of being used? >> my staff is telling me it's called the active denial system. >> that's a great name for that. [laughter] >> couldn't have named it better myself. is that in the prototype stage? >> i saw that demonstrated but it's been a couple of years ago and i don't know what's happened actually since then. >> thank you, admiral. chairman, i yield back. >> thank you. a couple more areas i want to   ask back and we'll go back through the members as well. piracy that's been emerging as a threat and a challenge. i guess, congratulations is the word in the operation in rescue the maersk crew. it's a very impressive accomplishment and it's great. but all those years ago you were trained to do, you know, basically were set up so ifthere was a hostage situation anywhere in the world you could respond very, very quickly. you've been doing a lot of other things in between but it was very impressive to see that training paid off and we knew what to do. now, going forward in terms of how we confront piracy. certainly it's a challenge in that part of the world off the coast of somalia and there's huge implications that we need to try and confront. at the same time, as we've mentioned in this hearing you have a wealth of other responsibilities that are also important in afghanistan and pakistan and a variety of other places and one of my concerns is   that with the media attention on piracy coming up, you know, if we shift too much of our focus in that direction we distract from these other very important missions as well. i just wonder if you could comment how you see socom's role in combating piracy in that part of the world and any concerns you have about how it may distract from some of the other missions? >> yes, sir. we have obviously across the military there's robust capability to take on piracy in different ways.and special operations contributes some of the capability to that as was evidenced here a couple months ago. how that force is used is a matter of policy. it's my responsibility to train the force to do what it is it's asked to do. we do keep some elements of our force on standby, on alert to respond to that kind of situation so that if they are infrequent, then i think we would consider it not to be much --   >> and that is all i need in the case. even with everything that's been going on in the last eight years, it's always been the case that you've had that standby force. >> yes, sir. >> i'm sorry. i didn't mean to interrupt if you have anything else. >> again, it's more of a policy issue, but the question is, is really are we -- are we going to prevent piracy or are we going to respond to piracy with a military force? today we'd been more in thebusiness of -- with my force of responding to those -- of providing those who respond to it and we're able to continue with that mission without impacting on our others. >> certainly. mr. miller? >> i'll pass. >> okay. i got more questions. but mr. mcintyre, do you have anything you want to add? >> do you feel like that the partnership with nato and their special operations capability is working well?   >> sir, and we did address that briefly earlier but the nato special operations coordination center, the nscc headquarters is an open running operation, it's not fully manned and fully capable yet. but the relationships that have occurred within that organization have developed quite strong bonds among the nato special operation forces. i was able to attend their first annual conference last year, 28countries i believe came to that conference and it was remarkable how similar the conversation were, the vision is across the special operations forces of nato, some of which feel they have more in common with the special operation forces of other nations than they do with other forces on their own because of the way they train and exercise. i think that there's an opportunity to take that to the next step. i'm just not certain what the   next step is. and what i mentioned before is that we might explore a way to operationalize the nato south coordination center in some way and provide an independent director who's now a dual-headed officer. >> thank you. >> and following up on that, there's a trip that i took in january with some members on the way back from iraq we stopped and had a chance to visit the special operation forces in natoin command and i can't tell you how impressed we were by the degree of coordination and without getting into too many detailed aspersions. we did not find other similar coordination in nato that we had met. that's a major, major challenge in afghanistan. how to get our partner nations -- it would be far too ambition to say on the same page but at least in the same book when it comes to how we're going to confront afghanistan and pakistan. and nato is set up the way it's set up.   it's an important alliance. it's very difficult to manage that many different countries coming from that many different perspectives so i certainly have a fair amount of respect that the difficulty the organization faces but we went through all that meeting on that with increasing frustration and we didn't have as much time as i would like is to visit the force and it was inspirational and we saw that it can work. you can, in fact, bring that many different nations together to coordinate in a way that iseffective and i guess my plea would be that the forces over there try to spread that message more broadly among the other aspects of nato. it would be very, very critical. >> sir, if i could make -- >> please, go ahead. >> i didn't mean to attribute more countries to nato or more to this conference. what we're seeing actually is an extension of special operations cooperation beyond nato and those who participate in other operations where they may work   with a nato soft country are now becoming part of this team so this first annual conference we came to last year was actually attended by some nonnato countries because they choose to develop those relationships. it's really encouraging to see this play out. >> and it's invaluable as the mantra of counterinsurgency by through and with. you want to work with the host nations and many of them are now participating in this and learning the necessary skills to implement that policy.i want to ask a little bit about some of the contracting issues and it's something we've dealt with and what we've always tried to do on this committee is find ways to enable socom to have a slightly more nimble approach to acquisition. that, you know, the normal processes are difficult when you're operating at such speed and with so much technology that's rapidly changing. if you go through a normal 18-month acquisition process by the time you've acquired the product, it is out of date so we've tried to speed it up in a couple different areas. i'm curious how you think that   is going in general and i also wanted to give you an opportunity to respond -- i know ""the washington post"" had written an article recently critical of some of that contracting that it hadn't followed the process in some instances. i have a very strong bias that, you know, drowning the d.o.d. in process is one of the things that is inhibiting our ability to move forward but that's not to say that we don't need it off, you know, some transparent process so that we make sure that it's all on the up and up and done in the best interest of the taxpayers. i want to give you an opportunity to comment on a couple of those issues and whereyou see it headed. >> yes, sir. i certainly agree with you. i am encouraged by all that secretary of defense gates said about relooking at how acquisition is done department wide with an eye towards cost reduction and streamlining acquisition processes. within the special operations command as you said, we are intended by congress i believe to be more agile than the services can be with their large   acquisition programs using our mfp11 budget for the special operations peculiar acquisition procurement -- procurement actions that we take. i focused on this a couple of years ago and investigating our own house i realized that many of the barnacles that have grown on our process were barnacles that we let grow. as i termed it within my own headquarters, i thought that we were operating comfortably sortof in the middle of our authorizations and certainly not pushing the edge of it. so we've got several initiatives within our own headquarters to provide more agility internally along the way. we have sought and been granted relief from participation in some of the service-wide joint acquisition processes which had been applied probably improperly   to special operations programs so vice chairman of the joint chiefs who runs some of this processes has relieved us of those where the acquisition project -- program is a special operations peculiar program. we do operate under all the same laws and policies and reporting requirements. we've got a ways to go in terms of continuing to scrape the barnacles off but i think we're making progress in that regard.and we will certainly continue to report to you how that is going. but i'm encouraged by what we've seen here just in the last few months. with respect to the dod-ig report that was not an acquisition contracting issue. that was a contract that we led with a single provider of many services to the special operations community. modify equipment.   they maintain equipment. they repair equipment and refurbish it. they store equipment for us. they do build sort of small one-off items for us and design and build those. it's a -- it's a comprehensive set of activities that they -- that they perform for us. and the dod-ig report highlightethree findings two of which we concurred mostly with and have taken several internal actions to resolve working with ig and i think to their satisfaction. the third one actually had to do with a potential antideficiency act violation which it was our responsibility to conduct a preliminary review of. we did that. our preliminary review identified that the -- that the   finding had some merit. there was -- there is the potential of an a.d.a. violation so this week my comptroller has initiated a formal investigation into that finding which is our responsibility to do. we have nine months to report the results of that investigation. we have about -- we have 90 days to respond formally to the -- to the release of the final ig report.>> can i have one more question while i'm looking at my colleagues, anything else? just in focusing for a moment, as long as we have you here, i would be interested on your take on afghanistan and pakistan on the various situations there. in particular, two areas. in both, and this is something general mccrystal highlighted in his comments yesterday and the day before yesterday of in of the senate, you know, talking about, you know, the balance between confronting the enemy and being able to track down the   terrorists that threaten us and at the same time protecting against civilian casualties and taking a more classic counterinsurgency approach. and i agree with general mccrystal that we need the afghan people on our side and right now the two greatest threats of them being on our side are number one the civilian casualty issue. both real and in some cases, i think, generated by taliban propaganda but we need to get better at countering that propaganda, getting our own message out but also it is avery, very real concern and, of course, the other issue is the efficacy of the afghan government, which the people of afghanistan do not believe in. i think certainly the best approach there is to try to go local as much as possible. the afghan people far more trust their tribes and the local provincial government other than what the government winds up and not to say that the national   government will be better as well but balancing afghanistan in going forward, how do you see the best approach in striking that balance? and the second question, you know, with regard to pakistan. this issue affects pakistan as well. in fact, david kilcullen testified before the committee a while back saying the strikes -- the drone strikes in the fatah are actually fairly well thought of in the fatah because the people who live there have been, you know, dealing with these violence psychopaths who havebeen running their communities. it's in pakistan itself and in afghanistan where the civilian population sees this as a threat to their sovereignty and, therefore, is less likely to be supportive of us. but also specifically pakistan needs to learn counterinsurgency. and i won't go through the litany of challenges there. you know them well. but we need to be able to help them while at the same time we have a limited role to play. i mean, their sovereignty is   very important. it's incredibly important to getting support for their government that we not have too heavy of a hand there. i guess my two questions at the end are, what can we do to better help pakistan get to the counterinsurgency level that they need to get at? 'cause as successful as they've been in swat and other regions recently, it's been a pretty heavy-handed conventional approach that's created 2 to 3 million refugees even as it's driven the taliban. that's number one and number twohow do you see us striking the balance in afghanistan between fighting the people we need to fight and stopping the number of civilian casualties? >> sir, i think you said it better than i could and i support what general mccrystal said in his confirmation hearing a couple days ago. if i could go to pakistan first. >> please. >> i think that we can't -- we can't help pakistan more than they want to be helped. and one of the filters on sort   of their willingness to be helped is how -- is how the pakistan military is perceived within pakistan. it is the strongest element of pakistan historically. it is the element of government upon which the people depend and i think that we have to be very careful in recognizing that we can't take actions that would cause the pakistan military to appear to the pakistani people to be an extension of ours. we can only help them in a waythat truly helps them and they are much more expert in that than we are. so i think the best thing we can do is develop the relationships that will erode whatever atmosphere of distrust exists. help the pakistani people understand that our interests there are theirs and that our commitment is a long-term commitment for the good of   pakistan and the stability of the region. but it will require us to work very carefully and very wisely with the pakistan government, with the pakistan military and the frontier corps. regarding afghanistan, i would highlight that afghanistan is a uniquely complex environment. counterinsurgency in afghanistan is very different than it has been anywhere else.where we have operated. it is really a village by village valley by valley counterinsurgency. one of the things that i'm finding myself saying more often is that presence without value is perceived as occupation and in afghanistan in particular, occupation is resisted -- it's simply their culture to resist outsiders. they pride themselves -- they pride themselves on a long history of resisting outside influence.   much of afghanistan has not felt the presence -- the impact of a central government in kabul ever. and as you said, the -- i think a large part of our goal there is to encourage the people who are now deciding where their allegiance will be, it's urging -- it's causing them todecide to place their bet with a legitimate government. at whatever level that is. whether it's legitimate tribal, local, regional or federal government. it will come down to ultimately where they place their bet. and i think in absence of solid metrics it will be our sense of where the people are beginning to place their bets that will lead us to understand whether or not our efforts are successful   in the hinterlands of afghanistan. that will require a careful approach. it will require a small as footprint as we can get away with in the places we go with the capability and the security considerations as part of that. it will -- it will require i believe a shift towards -- moreof a shift towards true local regional knowledge, however that is obtained. we are -- we have to get beyond generalizations in afghanistan into true deep knowledge of tribal relationships, family histories, the nuances of the terrain and weather and how that affects how business is done, money is made, how their world operates.   if we are to be predictable in our affects, i think an awful large part of what we've got to develop is an ability to be -- i said that wrong. i don't mean predictable in our affects, i mean, accurate in our predictions of our affects. we have got to have a better sense of the impact of our behavior as we put our plans together to work in the remote regions of afghanistan.i think this is a long-term commitment for us in order to build that depth of knowledge and then allow it to have the impact in the places where that needs to occur. this will not be people deciding overnight where their allegiance is. it's going to have to be convincing them over a long period of time that they are better off placing their bet with the local regional   governments than with the illegitimate power players in the region. >> as so frequently happens in asking that question i thought of one more. shifting to africa. we recently did a codel in parts africa and got a brief on aqim and mali, algeria and we know there is activity o","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 5, 2009 9:00am-9:30am EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

[inaudible] are you going to press him and others to back off of that? >> i think everybody brings their own individual views to the table and certainly we will be talking about that as members of the judiciary committee, but my own view is that we ought tocome with an open mind and be, and do their research, do their reading of 17 years of judicial opinions, and speeches and the like and to then be able to ask the nominee about them. i think it is really, i don't think it is wise for myself to be making decisions before the opportunity to ask her questions at a hearing. >> can you tell us about the questionnaire that is coming out shortly? >> i just read the my blackberry   that apparently she had turned it in but i have-nots in the answers to a. certainly it is a very conference of questionnaire so we will be going over that carefully. it may give rise to questions we will have to ask the hearing. of course as you know there's also a throw at the that background investigation and has to take place. the american bar association ordinarily does an investigation, talking to lincoln's and colleagues and the like and rendering an opinion on the qualifications of the nominee. i did tell judge sotomayor ofthe conversation i had with president obama was kind enough to call me a couple of weeks ago and i told them that we would treat this nominee fairly and the recognize his prerogative to choose somebody of his own choosing, but i said mr. president, with all respect i hope you can convince the democratic leaders and the senate not to try to jam this through based on some artificial timetable. that will make this on necessarily contentious and i think will not, not give the   nominee nor show respect for senators in their obligations under the constitution. >> so you are pleased with a time table? >> when would you like to see the confirmation hearings? >> i assume that hearings would be sometime in july. what i'm worried about is i'm also on the finance committee and senator baucus and senator reid have talked about getting a comprehensive health reform bill passed before we break in august so i think there's going to be a big collision potentially of things, and i think rather thando it in haste we ought to do it right and on both counts. >> you just said she would not be denied-- [inaudible] >> i think you know, i won't say, i will say there is in some resentment on the part of some republicans in the way the republican nominees have been treated in the past and i can't speak for them. my own view is that i hope that will not be necessary, but we won't know that until we get for   their, further into the process. thank you all very much. >> so, how many meetings have you done today already? >> i have lost track. they have all been wonderful, but there is a lot of them. >> are you trying to meet withevery member of the senate? >> i don't know what the schedule is right now. this is the first time where i don't control my own life. >> an unusual circumstance. i hear your question there has now been officially submitted to the judiciary committee in a record number of days. >> i was not aware of that. >> so, the white house put out  statement comparing how long it took for your questionnaire   versus some of the previous nominees so apparently you have one that price. [laughter] >> thanks guys. >> thank you. >> i know the answer to that. i have a very good discussion, which the judge. we covered a wide range of issues. we spent considerable timetalking about the comments in a speech that she gave, where she said that a wise latino women would make better decisions than white males. that was a comment that had troubled me, so i questioned her at length about it. the judge explain to me that she had intended it to be an aspirational comment comment that she speaks to young people very often, and tries to be a   world model for them, that she enjoys teaching, and that she enjoys setting an example. she assured me that she ender stands when deciding cases, that she needs to put aside any personal experiences that might cover her decisions, and as she said, that the lot is the law. that she applies the law and the facts of the case to reach yourdecisions. i was pleased to hear that. i astor what decision of hers she thought i should read. she said the pappas decision and i am going to pull that decision to read as being indicative of her political-- her judicial philosophy. it was a very useful, link in depth discussion. we talked about respect for the role of law and precedents. we talked about which supreme   court justice, living or dead, she most admired. i asked her a wide range of questions about her judicial philosophy, her approach to discrimination cases and it was going to be very helpful as i continued to review her record. >> senator, in that questionnaire she provided, there is another speech, the berkley speech in which she also said it was latino woman might be expected to reach a betterconclusion in a case then the white man. ginn no, is this a pattern? does that raise more red flags for you? did she tell you this was an isolated thing? >> she told me that she had used the phrase before but that she would not be using it again in the future, which did not surprise me. she is clearly a very bright individual, who learns from our past mistakes.   >> will you support her? >> i have not made a decision. this discussion today was very helpful to me, but i have always found that it is wise to wait until the judiciary committee concludes its hearings, because there can be additional information that is brought out. i also do wanted to wait for their redo you of decisions that she has issued to satisfy myself about her cautious respect forthe law. >> you see her as as sort of a moderate, essentially moderate justice or conservative and how did she then in the spectrum from your initial conversation with her? >> until library fuhrer cases, it is difficult for me to make that assessment. she has told me that she had been described as being a centrist jurists, but she said that she wasn't quite sure what that term ends, and since i   consider myself to be a centrist senator, i could tell her what that means, but in any event in all seriousness i think that i need to reduce some of, more of the decisions that she has issued. >> were there discussions-- [inaudible] >> i was somewhat frustrated that she felt constrained from discussing the new haven firefighters case. from my review of that case, idisagree with her decision and i think it was an unfair result. so, i had wanted to question her at some length about that decision, but she said, and it is a legitimate concern, that she feels prohibited from discussing that case while it is pending before the supreme court. so, i accept that answer but since that is one of her most controversial rulings, it was   frustrating to not be able to discuss that. >> fu wizard favorite justice? >> her favorite justice was just as cordoza. should we went into a long discussion. i don't think i should speak for her on that. >> do you feel it has been put to bed even though she made the statement on several occasions? >> i am still uncomfortable that she made the statement, particularly as a sitting judge.i can understand her explanation that it was intended to be a statement to inspire the young people with whom she was talking. and that it did not reflect how she approaches cases before it, but that is why i want to read more of her cases, to reassure myself-- >> you can read judge sotomayor's questionnaire   required to file federal judicial nominees by going on line to c-span.org and clicking on the feature links.>> now a hearing on hurricane preparedness with the head of fema and other officials. the latest forecast calls for 14 tropical storms in 2009, seven of which could become hurricanes. this is a little less than two hours.   >> good afternoon. arza committee on disaster recovery will come to order. and let me welcome everyone that his joined us today for what i think it's a very important hearing and what is one of a series of hearings that will have happened or are happening today and will continue to happen as we strive to get our nation's response in the very best possible shape that we canfour hurricanes and all disasters, and that is the subject of this hearing today. to see where we are and have the opportunity to have on our first panel the new fema administrator, who will be testifying today for the first time since his confirmation. welcome mr. fugate in major-general grass from missouri who will be testifying today as well. let me say that this hearing is   focused on hurricane response, because we started hurricane season this week. but, we will be examining issues that affect not just the hurricane region, but all regions of the country in this hearing today. and we will be focusing on plants and processes that actually have applicability across the board for many different types of threats, beit hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.. the ranking member and i both represent states that have seen large portions of the hour states, major cities and very important rural areas devastated by a recent hurricanes. 2004, 2005 and 2008 were particularly hard years for cities and communities   throughout the gulf coast from florida to texas. but the last century has been difficult for many, many states and i would like to put the first chart up. these are the numbers of hurricanes that have hit the, this particular region of the country which is the hurricane belt from 1955 to 2005. the blue line is hurricanekatrina, which was the greatest among all the storms depicted there by a significant amount in terms of size of damage. and then hurricane rita, which ranks second the monks those storms in terms of damage. and i would like to show you the   next graph, which is even more startling, are the storm since 1851 to the present. so, when we in the gulf coast talk about the threat, it is real, it is frightening, and it is important for this committee and all committees of this congress to continue to focus as best we can on the sure threatof hurricanes that they are getting more and more predictable. we know and can be better focused on where they are going to hit and when they are hitting, unlike earthquakes although our science is getting much better on earthquakes and fires as well, but we have gotten pretty good at predicting where the storms will hit. there is very little we can do i think immediately to stop them but we most certainly can   prepare our people better for the threat that they are facing. it is important for us to understand our capacity to deal with these real end on going and in some people's minds ever strengthening threats, and that is what this committee will focus on and has focused on since the wake-up call of katrina, which will be four years august 29th.we want to make sure that we continue this lion's necessary to make more scientific base predictions and warnings for people so that they tomoka out of the way of these powerful storms. we want to make sure that there evacuation routes are clear and secure, and that the rules and regulations of, involving evacuation are clear to the millions of people that have to use them as well as to those of us organizing the evacuations. what will people be reinforced   for and what they will be reimbursed for is of particular interest to me. immediately stabilizing water, food and medicine to all of the people that flee from storms like this is important and we haven't quite got net right yet. where do people that flee these storms, where do they live in the event that they can't go back to the house or the shelter or the apartments or the place, nursing homes, hospitals thatthe evacuated from? where do we shelter them and who pays for that and how long? and then what do we do to recover these communities when they are big cities, large metropolitan areas of multimillions of people, how do we help the small rural communities that don't get any attention from anybody once the wind and waves are gone. how do we help them to recover? and i would suggest that we have a lot of work to do.   i would like to say a few words about the devastating hurricanes that struck texas and louisiana last year because the response to those demonstrated progress that has been made as well as demonstrated the requirement for significant improvement. the evacuations for gustav and ike were the largest in u.s. history. louisianans moved to a million people out of harm's way, including the elderly, the disabled and those withouttransport, nbs some people were left behind. texas kept residence at hamza wrote could be cleared for people on the coast to flee from mike without getting stuck in traffic as they did win a rita was approaching. communications and coordination between different levels of government was better. fema declared free landfall disasters in both states and search resources and to the areas before impact, and in most   instances the federal levees held. however, in sufficient quantities of generators forced hospitals and baton rouge to evacuate patients. and sufficient supply of generators caused gas stations to shut down, which almost caused a panic in a major metropolitan area has four weeks people could not access any gasoline. when people can't access gasoline, they can get to work. it shows the economy down.people start getting laid off of work. even within a week or two of the storm, that could happen. we can afford the loss of jobs right now i might remind the people testifying today. local governments waited days for commodities like ice and water and tarps. the state of louisianans bus contractor failed. with the kiwis were forced thousands to take school buses without air-conditioning, which doesn't seem like much except it   is 100 degrees out in your bus ride is ten ours are longer. it becomes the real issue for people who are sick or elderly or for small children to sit still on the bus is very hard particularly if they have to do so without bathrooms. in evacuees from texas and louisiana i arrived in shreeveport and, just to to give examples and i have watched these shelters myself that were wholly inadequate. there were no cots, there wereno blankets, there were inadequate showers and people were forced to sleep on floors because the cotton towels did not arrive until 17 days after people arrived, so it was a very interesting couple of weeks for the mayors of those towns, which did their very level best to make a bad situation better. local levees in south louisiana failed again.. they feel that katrina, they feel that read it, they failed at gustav and ike and as the   minister knows, because he is from florida, the people of south florida are very concerned about their water management issues and whether their tykeson levels-- levees will hold and that is the subject of another hearing. recovery as continue to be frustrating and a cumbersome process for individuals and local governments despite many improvements, which i will mention in a moment. i believe we are still relying mr. fugate, too much on trailersin order to jump-start recoveries and we are going to be pressing hard on new housing and shelter options from this committee. i will continue to say that providing these communities with $5 million in community loan assistance is probably not what charleston or savannah or miami or new orleans or atlanta or baton rouge or any number of   communities. they can't do much with $5 million that is all the law allows them to borrow. so, administrator fugate, female will discuss the 2008 response and the agency's work on alerting warning systems, evacuation plans and from his perspective for a better situation as the 2009 season opens. major-general grass from u.s. northern command will outline the department defense's supportmission for hurricane response, including aerial storm surveillance, are medevac, search and rescue, communications support, logistic support, reason hurricane response exercises and northcom's coordination with the state national guard. it is a lot but we are going to try to get that in and i will mention were very proud to have the general with us and he is from the missouri national guard which is of particular interest to senator mccaskill.   then in our next panel we will have george foresman, former dhs official who was here today to talk about the private sector will because this committee chairmen, the chair and making member and member's recognize it is not just the federal government. it is state and local government. it is individuals. it is the private sector and the non-profit sector. we want to give them a voice. we also are happy to hear fromfrank. they have gone through a major transformation since katrina. were very interested in hearing about the fact that they have increased their volunteer base from 23,000 to 90,000 we think it is not only a bigger but a better red cross and we are excited about hearing it because i think americans look to the red cross to give them particular strength and comfort at times of disaster and that of course has been a key role of the red cross for many years.   finally mrs. janet durden joins us on behalf of a committee in northeast louisiana which i am very proud. my husband's hometown and in katrina, they did a phenomenal job through their 211 as the office is dropped off of their ability in south louisiana, north louisiana picked up as i am sure the same thing happened in texas and in alabama and mississippi and florida is thestorms come in, the northern part of the state picks up the great amount of help. we want to hear about the increased activity of the 211 operation, which is sort of the go-to the operation when people need help and assistance. they don't call 911, they call 211 and we want to help americans understand that. with that opening statement i would like ask mr. fugate-mag good to see a senator.   i would like to ask mr. fugate, if you can let me ask senator burris, i know you are just coming in and welcome. do you want to make any brief opening statements or should we go right to the panel? thank you, thank you senator. we are happy to have craig fugate with us who is the new administrative from the muck, and man that i supported and keep my wholehearted support for and many members of the senate. you are","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 4, 2009 10:00pm-10:30pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

>> well, the importer fi refers to the use of on the individual's warrant the companies that are serving as the link between foods that are ground, processed, manufactured   overseas, and being brought into the united states to be distributed to consumers here. and so they are not necessarily representing a given manufacturer, but it is a very important pontian because it is that bridge between what is happening on the international arena and was coming into this country for use.>> specifically with regard to the drug and device manufacturers who currently already register and pay a fee, would you envision that they're going to have to pay an additional registration fee in addition to what the fda already collects from blacks and if so, why? >> in terms of the importer function, i need to go back and look to this issue to speculative devices because i don't know how the system is set   up, whether the manufacturer that it is serving in that role or not, so i will look back. >> will you take a look at that? that is one that we need to look at and i don't think we ought to be duplicating what you already are doing because you have jurisdiction there. i think that would be unfair. let me ask you also quickly, with regard to and the tracing of food and, the tracing system that has been put in place for you to issue regulations.it appears that that would include the reference to be able to have traceability and i am told that about seven add of every 10 eating establishments are not part of chain operations, they're just independence separate food operations. i am just curious as to whether or not you think that this would have a serious impact on the small business owners and you think we ought to do a cost-benefit analysis before we   impose that kind of cost on these individuals? >> well, i think clearly we want to work with restaurant owners and small businesses in order to make sure that the systems are not too cumbersome but it is very important that they keep records because if there is a tainted food that is in their facility, the implications for the health of their business aswell as to the health of their consumers is very significant indeed, and i think that they would want to be able to assist in sharing their information about the where the fruits came from so that the trace back can occur and we can identify the source of an outbreak and control at. so i think there are very important links in the food supply chain and protecting health really depends on them   keeping records. >> let me ask you, what has fda done to implement the current what i think is called the one up one back traceability requirements? what has been done to implement that? >> well, the one up one back has been in place as i understand it for a while now. but it has proven not to be adequate to really capture thefull life cycle of a product and that we really needed as we mentioned earlier the full supply chain to be documented in integrated, interoperability, not just fragments here and it's really key to successful and swift investigation of outbreaks in the ability to control the problem and prevent future exposures to contaminated food   product. >> thank-you. just the way we are proceeding, mr. markey is going to go out and he is our last questioner for you, dr. hamburg. we have won the votes, we'll be right back after that and then we will start with the second panel so mr. mark kikkoman thank you mr. chairman very much, congratulations dr. hamburg. you may know that i have a bill that calls for bpa to be bannedfrom being used in food and beverage containers because of the risks that have been identified. we have also recently learned that food and chemical industries have launched a public-relations campaign opposing any efforts to deal with this issue. is the fda concern about bpa? and what does the fda plan to do about those concerns?   >> well, we are concerned. certainly i am aware of some of the study is that have raised issues in an animal populations in some of the information about bpa in many components of the food supply. we are starting to see activities at the local and state level in terms of actionwith respect to bpa and i would hope that fda could really be providing leadership on some of these issues of assessing and analyzing resco. we are taking another look at the bpa issue, the acting chief scientist of the fda has been asked to take the lead on this because, of course, this is a decision where we have to bring the best available scientific data to bear.   we need to look at all of the studies and examined them. but it is an issue of great consequence for americans. as a mother as well as a physician, it's an issue that i think we need to look as seriously and afford to be able to come back with some reports from a serious look at is being taken and we expect that it is going to be a task for him overthe summer to leave this review. by the end of the summer beginning of all we come to be able to put forward a fresh look at the bpa issue. >> the you have any advice for parents who are concerned about their children ingesting this chemical? >> well, i think, of course,   parents are concerned can find alternatives that don't have bpa. and for the most part i think that those alternatives are pretty clearly labeled and pretty available and i think anyone with concerns, you know, should do so. >> okay, thank you for your work on this and if you could keep us posted on the progress you are making an evaluation, thank you so much. thank you mr. chairman. >> thank you very much dr. hamburg. as we have said, we do intend tomove toward on this bill next week and we appreciate your input and whenever, as you have to give us by next monday. my intention is we have one vote, we'll come back and hear from our second panel. thank you. >> thank you for your leadership on this important issue. [inaudible conversations]   [inaudible conversations] [inaudible conversations][inaudible conversations] >> the subcommittee will reconvene in. and i see our second panel is already seated. let me introduce you to view. on my left is missile -- mr. michael ambrosio from a. representing the food marketing quality assurance issue.   next we have a ms. pamela bailey who is president and chief executive officer of the grocery manufacturers association, and then we have met miss caroline smith dewaal, who is the safe food coalition food safety director of the center for science in the public interest. dr. tim jones who was the state of pd -- epidemiologist from the tennessee department of health, and last is mr. thomas stenzelwho is president and ceo of united fresh produce association. well, you know it is five minutes and obviously your staymans become part of the record if you -- if you want to include material more than a five minutes, and we all heard before, i know some of you wondered if you could meet the deadline, but since we do intend to go to market next week i agreed with what -- you brought   it up -- mr. shimkus said it will give you any additional written timon and we like them back by monday at the end. so we will start with michael ambrosio. thank you for being here again. >> thank you, chairman pallone, members of the subcommittee come i'm honored to appear on behalf of the food marketing institute to present our views and suggestions on the food safety enhancement act discussion draft. which of the common goal of enacting legislation this yearthat will genuinely improve the safety of the food supply. steps that prevent the presence of adulterants in the food supply are only true way to improve the safety of our food and i'm vice president of quality of insurance and i have been in charge of food safety programs for to 30 years. about it in 1946, we have grown from small struggling cop and into the nation's largest retailer non farm cooperative in the united states. we're had bernanke speaker new   jersey, along with the store's employees over 47,000 individuals in new jersey, new york in something of a delaware, massachusetts, rhode island and maryland. today i am representing national trade association that has 1500 member companies made up of food retailers and wholesalers in the u.s. and around the world. at them i never saw. approximately 26,000 retail boosters with combined annual sales of roughly $400 billion representing three-quarters ofall retail food store sales in the u.s.. that fmi membership is composed of regional chains as well as independent grocery stores here this morning out presents several of fmi recommendations for revising the bill but i ask my entire salmon be included in the record. in april 2008i testified before the subcommittee on legislation now have modernized overhaul the food safety systems that the food and drug administration and since that time high profile of to say the operation recalls   involving tomatoes, jalapenos, peanuts and mustachios have not only it had guns but regrettably acosta listen in some cases even that. many of the themes and ideas that i share today will be similar to those i shared in 2008 but their differences the reflect lessons learned and new witnesses in the existing food safety system identified from the latest recalls. as the purchasing agent for the concern and of the supply chain our industry understands it is vital to ensure that the fdahave necessary authority and resources to meet the challenges of today's global marketplace. consumer confidence remains an essential factor in this debate, food safety issues can be extremely complex and consumers weary greatly in their knowledge of the science and other issues affecting the safety of our food supply. however, as food safety issues drawn national headlines consumer awareness is well concern about the safety of commercially prepared food and products purchased at the supermarket tie-ins. mr. chairman, i applaud you,   chairman waxman and all members of the committee for your efforts to address changes needed to improve our food safety system. we support many of the proposals in the draft by emphasizing the need to have preventive measures been the foundation on which the food safety system should be built. the draft also recognized we need to focus on a majority of resources on facilities and products that pose greatest risk of contamination that could result in foodborne illness or injury and now we must continue to be sure that any changes incertain criteria and supported by science and i have measurable benefits, be affordable, be realistic and be implemented without unintended consequences. first we applaud you for not only designating an entire section of the bill to prevention but also putting this first and most extensive section of the bill. in harper's by the of this is the proper emphasis. addition out like to specifically comment on certain sections of the draft. fmi recognizes strong public-private partnership is needed to help insure safety of   the food supply although every penny counts in these tough economic times, there is nothing more important in improving and insure the safety of our food supply. we are willing to support a thir registration or user fee provided in is utilized by the fda in a chance and an accountable manner to improve the safety of our food supply through means such as connecting researching consumer education programs. we look for to working with the committee to address our concerns about how the fda and may utilize any fees collectedand we support the requirement that every registered for a facility conduct risk assessments and implement and maintain relative food safety plan and identify potential resources of contamination and of proper food safety controls and document those controls that will eliminate potential hazards here and adherence to food safety plans goes a long way toward developing a culture within a company that is critical to ensuring food safety. mr. chairman, thank you for the opportunity to testify, we appreciate the work that has gone into development of the   food safety enhancement act discussion draft with the goal of improving food safety. and helping to restore consumer confidence in the food safety system. i look for two questions and remain available to the subcommittee, thank you. >> thank you. miss bailey. >> thank you mr. chairman, good afternoon. >> i don't know if the mike is on, you don't have a mike geren. >> thank you. i'm months president and ceo of the grocery manufacturers association which representsmore than 300 food, beverage and consumer-products companies. americans enjoy one of the safest food supplies in the world but we recognize that steps can and must be taken to make our food supplies even safer. the we applauded chairman waxman, chairman emeritus dingell, chairman stupak and chairman pallone for developing the food safety enhancement act of 2,009. product safety is the foundation of consumer trust. we look for to working with a quick committee to quickly   enough to save the reforms that will restore consumer confidence and continually improve the safety of our food supply. although the food industry is ultimately responsible for the safety of our products strong government oversight is a critical part of our food safety system. that is why gm made supports must in the draft including a proposal to set safety standards for food and vegetables proposals to improve the safety of imported food and food ingredients and proposals togive fda strong enforcement power to do with bad actors including mandatory recall authority. in particular we strongly support proposals to require all food manufacturers to conduct a hazard analysis to identify potential sources of contamination, and identify appropriate prevented controls and document those preventive controls includes a plan here, we believe that this safety plans are the cornerstone of prevention and that they will help insure the safety is built in from the very beginning.   we have proposed modifications to some of these provisions to your staff and will afford to working with you. in particular we look for to working with you to address your concerns about traceability. we recognize that the discussion draft is stocks fda to assess the cost benefits and feasibility of traceability technologies and gives fda the power to exempt certain foods. furthermore recognize that discussion draft and stocks fdato compile a province of public meetings, however, we believe the studies, meetings and pilot roger should be completed before fda this is how to assign the food industry the responsibility for tracking food product and which coding and identification systems may be the best suited to this task as you anticipate in the draft, the cost and feasibility of requiring every manufacturer to maintain the full pedigree of every ingredient in every food may outweigh the public health   benefits. to address concerns raised during the pinette product recall, we urge you to consider whether intimated distributors and brokers should include on the labeling of their bulk ingredients the identity of the increases apply here. in general we support proposals to get the fda stronger enforcement powers including the power to order a recall. we believe the answer and enforcement provisions of the discussion draft such as mandatory recall and suspension of registrations should only beexercised by senior agency officials when there's a risk of serious adverse health consequences and should ensure that companies are reporting certain to process protection such as administrative hearing. as we saw during the recent recalls of tomatoes and jalapeno peppers, recalls can have devastating financial impact. and the need to reflect the best science and why this agency judgment. finally we strongly support average to provide fda with additional resources, gma helped   create allies for stronger fda and we have worked with other consumer and industry groups to increase fda spending. of congress and ask that fyi 2010 request of the fda and obama administration we will have seen food safety spending at the fda increase by 80 percent since 2006. more bunning is needed, with a four to working with the committee to identify the appropriate role for industry and our industry is significantly increase our own investment for food safety and we are prepared to make additional investments tocontinually improve the safety of our food safety supply and to comply with many of the new mandates that are envisioned in the discussion draft. we are not opposed to all fees and i'm confident the committee can reach a bipartisan consensus on the agency's resources needs an appropriate role for industry. that may close by saying again that the food and beverage industry is committed to working with you to quickly enact a safe to legislation which makes the prevention of contamination the foundation of our food safety system.   thank you. >> thank you. >> thank you very much. thank you for your leadership, chairman pallone, and also the leadership of many other members of the subcommittee and committee. and also thank you to you're ranking member deal for the many hearings we have sat through. we have listened to the witnesses. this work has been going on for a long time and i thinkhopefully we are nearing an end in. and my name is caroline smith dewaal, director of food safety for the center for science in the public interest, but today i am representing 10 consumer public health and victims' advocacy organizations that are members of the safe food coalition. it let me begin by saying that we believe that this is a strong bill that will improve food   safety. it requires food companies to build into their processes the, not their regular hazard analysis and the have to institute preventive controls to prevent problems from occurring. it provides a modern framework for food safety oversight to replace the antiquated food safety laws that have hamstrung the food and drug administration. mcginnis fda as central authority to carry out the mission of preventing illnessesand outbreaks, and to inspect food plants much more frequently and it addresses the funding issues urgently needed to institute the programs improvement. doing this with a modest registration page. the hearts of any active reform effort lies and prevention, which is in in the bills hazard analysis and preventive control section. the bill provides fda with new   tools like written plans and access to processing records that will allow government inspectors to review the conditions and plans overtime. not just when inspectors are in the facility. we recommend additional strengthening of the bill by requiring companies or labs to report pathogens on final product samples to fda when ever they are encountered in a facility. this would give fda an earlywarning of problems and might prevent another tragedy by the outbreak linked to the peanut corporation of america of. it is a common added that you cannot detect which you don't inspect. random and frequent inspection by public officials is a necessary component of an effective food safety system. this legislation divides' food companies into three categories based on risk and iraq's fda to   inspect the facilities every six months to four years. while this is a vast improvement over fda's existing program, we continue to believe that more frequent inspections are needed to take nearly a high risk facility's. risk-based inspection is a concept that expands across the entire spectrum of food products, not just those regulated by fda. the registration fee as proposedis quite modest, and at a thousand dollars per facility it should provide it summer between the 300 and $400 million in new revenue for thune safety activities. let's put this be into context. in the peter pan outbreak, the average cost per victim reporting and no less was $2,650. and this is based on an estimate   using the economic research service cost calculator, so when there is an outbreak consumers who are affected may pay over $2,500 or more. these are individuals, so clearly a thousand dollar fee on each facility to avoid these problems is more than reasonable. especially when compared to the cost of individuals and families that you have had here before this committee testifying on asevere impact of foodborne illness. in addition, i would just like to note that companies themselves can run advertising campaigns to promote their products that run into the tense and even hundreds of millions of dollars. to conclude, i just want to say that the polling has shown that the public has lost confidence in the safety of food and. the percentage of consumers   confidence in food safety fell to about 22%, according to the university of minnesota's food industry center. this legislation provides a modern framework for fda's regulation of the food supply that will deliver many benefits to consumers, though it does stop short of structural reforms so we also think are essential. we appreciate your leadership and we believe that these newauthority is that you are proposing will over time prevent the outbreak san illnesses and help restore consumer confidence. earlier this year, members of the energy and commerce committee made commitments to the victims of the peanuts corporation of america outbreak, the change would come to fda. president obama said at a bare minimum we should be able to count on our government keeping our kids say when they eat peanut butter.   we urge you to have swiftly to finalize this legislation and to enact it. thank you. >> thank you. dr. jones. >> mr. chairman and members of the subcommittee, thank you to be here today. the recent high-profile outbreaks demonstrate the huge challenges and opportunities for piven in the nation's food supply this ap infrastructure. laws and policies to be frank philosophies developed decades ago no longer suffice.two successfully meet the new demands. the legislation we're discussing is there for a critical step in reviving the food safety capacities of the fda. i work in a state health department as an epidemiologist responsible for investigating foodborne diseases and in effect cleaning up the mess left when things go awry in the food safety chain. i'm excited to see this proposed legislation addresses many of the problems i experience firsthand.   in my role of investigating and helping prevent foodborne disease. improving the traceability of food called for in this legislation is fundamental to successfully achieving many of the other tasks described herein and traced back information have been more broadly available in shared pastor at the many other problems associated with the reason to made a jalapeno incidents could have been mitigated and likewise tracing peanut butter from one plant to 4,000 different commercial products would have been utterly impossible and types of foods.ensuring that all foods are traceable efficiently and accurately is critical to maintaining food safety. contamination of producer of foods which are eaten uncooked or a particular concern, because consumers have less control of the safety of those foods in their own kitchens. setting standards for pre harvest food production starts major gap in the food safety system. some suspect in protists associated ellises are particularly difficult to investigate the both of public   health and regulatory perspectives. while large food service corporations and their suppliers often have excellent quality control programs, with impeccable records, many other companies don't. the portions of this bill requiring country of origin labeling and improve distribution records and plans to regulate this a production of harvesting the fruits and vegetables are important to help address the problems. i am pleased to see that the agency is being encouraged

it's not a solution with the   states and as we work with ideas and concepts and work our states what other ideas do you come up with. how can we capture what resources are there? what's the best way to address that. we know that there's no one solution that fits every scenario and we want to make sure we are working with the states to build those housing task forces so that, unfortunately, these may occur in the future we have more options as we go forward. it's again a multidisciplined,multiteam approach. we need to have that operation and all buy-in. as i said working together sometimes we look at our planning process and we're so government centric we forget -- as you have some of the volunteer agencies that are remitted plus our partners with the american red cross and the people who promote the united way with 211 and brokering those resources it's critical we bring about that team approach and that we work as not just   representing government but what the private sector does. i mean, to me it's always the challenge, does it make sense to be distributing supplies when we have an open grocery store but we have other areas of the community that are not serve and we are going to build a government centric and we don't work but we have to build a team that will serve and support all our citizens but most importantly making sure our citizens have a role to be as prepared as they can so that when disaster strikes, we can focus on the most vulnerablecitizens 'cause we've done our part to get a plan to be ready and finally the last thing as my time runs out if we could ask folks that all this work that your committee is doing we can do a lot more when people do one more thing when disaster strikes. if you're okay, check on a neighbor. we can do a lot more working together than doing it from a government centric approach. >> spoken like a true local fema   operator. thank you for sticking to the 5 minutes but i want to be very liberal with you in your time because i do think that you have a great message to bring to the nation. major? >> chairman landrieu, senator burris, thank you for the opportunity today to present comments over the defense's support of civil liberties that we do at north com. i would like to take a moment commander dan baxter.he definitely understands the hurricane season, ma'am. >> it's very nice to meet you. >> we at northern command are privilege to be a member of the whole u.s. government approach to disaster response. including active guard and reserve alongside our federal, state, tribal and local partners. we started our planning this year well in advance of the past. we stand ready to assist the primary federal agencies in   responding quickly to manmade and natural disasters when directed by the president or the secretary of defense. when requested and approved by appropriate federal officials in accordance with the national response framework, we support civil authorities by providing specialized skills and assets to save lives, reduce suffering and restore infrastructure in the wake of catastrophic events in the homeland. last year during one of the most destructive hurricane seasons onrecord, we supported the department of homeland security and the federal emergency management agency in responding to three major hurricanes, gustav, hannah and ike all within a 13-day period. we continued to take significant steps in our response capabilities. first of all, we've incorporated the joint staff standing execution order to streamline defense support to civil authorities within operational planning for the 2009 hurricane   season. this joint staff execution order provides u.s. northern command commander the authority to establish operational staging areas, federal mobilization centers, national logistic support areas and department of defense base support installations to support fema. in addition our ten full-time defense coordinators and their staffs coordinate and plan continually with the fema regions. in collaboration with thedepartment of defense and department of homeland security we have developed prescripted mission for assignments for fema. we have 24 of those approved currently. it provides a menu of response capabilities with a cost to fema so they can quickly respond and request those mission assignments. based on anticipated requirements of medical evacuation, damage assessment and commodity distribution to mention just a few. and finally in 2009, february,   we cohosted the first national guard and northern command planning conference in february in south carolina. it brought together generals from the eastern and gulf coast states along with the chief of the national guard bureau and my boss, and to the opportunity to look at gaps and also work with fema and other interagencies and provide a list of shortfalls that we anticipate based on current deployments for the 2009 hurricane season.additional planning for the 2009 hurricane season included discussions with u.s. transportation command on medical evacuation, general population evacuation. discussions with the department of homeland security and also fema. health and human services and our service component commands. all of these are planning conferences and tabletop exercises we've conducted in preparations for this season. if and when called, northern command continues to stand ready   to provide robust support to civil authorities during the 2009 hurricane season. thank you for the opportunity to present today and i stand ready to answer your questions. >> thank you, general. we very much appreciate it. senator burris? >> thank you very much, madam chairman. and to our distinguished panel it's certainly a good opportunity to listen and learn what we're preparing for.and mr. fugate, we know that we had a bad -- it wasn't quite a tornado. so we hear a lot about hurricanes but inland a hurricane is a tornado and that's what we get in illinois. and my home as a matter of fact is in tornado alley down in southern illinois. and we just had a big storm to come through a few weeks ago and it wasn't quite at the tornado level. they call it a durado but it's   high winds that reaches at 75 miles per hour, is that correct mr. fugate? is that what they call it a durado? >> that's one term. you also may hear a microburst. my experience has been if you lose your roof it's kind of academic. >> it's a hell of a storm, right. [laughter] >> well, and we had a quite a bit of damage. and, of course, our governor has asked for some assistance and i'm just hoping that assistancewould be forthcoming because, unfortunately, in southern illinois there's a lot of poverty and there's just not that much resources so i hope we can get some assistance on that. are you familiar with that request that has been put in for southern illinois yet? >> i've not. i'll research it. it could be at the regional level. >> it's been six weeks. >> i've been on the job for about two weeks and three days. if i haven't seen it, i'll find out where it is, sir.   >> check it out for us. general, i was down in my national guard facility down in lincoln the other day. and we were talking about a coordination of the disasters of what our national guard does. we also have another issue called flooding off of that mississippi river. that ends up new orleans. but it comes down from illinois roaring like a mack truck doing 90 going like 55 and it leavesin its wake a lot of flooding and i was just wondering how does norcom coordinate with the national guard in terms of the disaster coordination? does it can through the national guard first? who is really in charge there? >> to answer your question, our coordination is with the national guard bureau but the first response will always be with the national guard supporting the state and local   officials, we, though, immediately upon indications that there's a disaster pending will continue -- will begin to coordinate with the national guard in case there are gaps in their capability to respond. and i talked with the national guard operations daily and looking across the country, looking at where they have forces deployed so we're prepared to respond if they have gaps. we recently responded to the flood in the red river of the north in north dakota working with the national guard in northdakota and minnesota and we provided some of active duty forces to back them up at the request of the federal emergency agency and we prepositioned -- >> pardon me, so you say your request can come from fema to you. now, does that have to originate at the state level? >> senator, the process by which we would activate northcom would be at the request of the state   and we would not have assets either within your national guard. we would mission task the folks at norcom to derive that assistance. this goes back to some of the issues that madam chairman had raised about previously. a lot of times these would be requests that we had not planned ahead of time. what we've done is after katrina and then after the hurricanes last year, we have developed what we call a prescripted mission which is essentially --we put together the types of things we would be asking for northcom trained those resources and has that ready to go rather than trying to describe our call up pieces to do something we could activate a mission package that norcom can go through our mission if it exceeds the capability of that national guard, we've oftentimes have built these packages for the   threats we know about so that whether it was to do a flood fight, whether it was to support mass care, whether it was to support commodity distribution or bring in specific equipment, these are the types of things that we have written out. i believe there's over 2 some 30 missions -- 260 some of those missions we've written out and that's in addition to the capability northcom could do. one of the things we tried to do in our after-action report iscapture anything that was different that we either needed to adjust that mission or we needed to create a mission support for and so that's a constantly evolving process each time we go through a disaster. >> you know, gentlemen, i have been a civilian until just coming back in the government.   what i'm certainly saying is that as a now public official it's good i know these things and hopefully can get a message out, you know, to the people that, you know, we are really prepared to assist in these situations. which lead me, mr. fugate, to another question. are you familiar with what the university of illinois has with this super computer that they are simulating the tornadoes and hurricanes and some simulating disasters on these computer models? i was down at the university ofillinois which has the fastest computer, madam chairman, in the whole country and what they showed me a demonstration of is a simulated tornado and they can then study this and then actually prepare it based on the atmospheric conditions that have actually taken place in the development of the various winds and velocities and all the other elements that are going to make up a tornado as well as simulating floods and a disaster   even in the city of chicago. they have this computer design that say there's a disaster in chicago. where's evacuation routes? do you know of any other facility where this is being studied computer wise or are these assimilations are taken place? >> senator, i know there's a lot of difficult products out there. i do not know directly about this but i will ask my staff to get with your staff so i can get briefed. >> i would like to let you knowwhat the university of illinois is coming up with in terms of the simulations and the preparations for it. >> thank you, senator. i'm actually aware of a center like that in louisiana. i don't know if our computer is as fast as but we'll see. a battle of computers between illinois and louisiana but i am very impressive with what several of our universities have done on the heels of katrina and rita and using technology that was there and building some strategic partners so let's explore the opportunity because   there may be some expertise out there, mr. fugate, i know at the university of lafayette 'cause i've seen it perhaps senator burris has a suggestion as well. i'd like to get to my line of questioning, if i could, senator, and we'll come back. i wanted to ask first, mr. fugate, what are your top three priorities? i know you have many. but if you could for this committee because we'd like towork with you, we're going to push. we're going to work with you but push to get the very best systems we can. so what are your top three priorities as you're stepping in to an agency that has, you know, really been at the front line in many ways these last few years? how do you see your top three priorities and i'm certain that you've discussed this with the secretary and with the highest   levels of believe administration. so would you outline that for us now? >> yes, ma'am. they're rather broad. they're easy to communicate and they require a lot of moving pieces. my greatest priority is to increase the responsibility of participation of our citizens to prepare for disaster. i truly believe that far too many of us who do not get ready, do not prepare oftentimes put our most vulnerable citizens in jeopardy as we compete for thoseneeded resources. in looking at these large scale type disasters i know that the more that those of us that can be ready, can be prepared the more successful the team will be. that's one. two, i really have, you know, come into this job with the understanding that in our response to the immediate needs to a establish and a governor we need to be focused on what the outcome we're trying to achieve and not necessarily look at process. i'm challenging the team as we have been participating in hurricane exercises to not   merely define our response by our capabilities but define the response by what is needed to support an impacted state and local government recognizing there are many parts of that partnership but as an example, it doesn't seem to me to be very effective in search and rescue operations that if we're not reaching the injured quickly that we're mobilizing staging exercises and it's two days after the event and we're not reaching the people.i would like to define what the outcome would be. let's work in partnership and say rather than wait for the disaster and try to bring it from the outside, how do we build that capability within those communities, within those states? and then where the federal government response how do we do that. but speed and stable is not what we can build capability to and say that's what the response will be but look at what could happen and go if that does, have we got all the parts of the team working together including our   support from the national guard from our active duty reserve components to achieve that. and not merely go -- we're going to incrementally improve something. that goes back to the crux you raise and some of the challenges we raised in 2008 such as hospitals we hadn't gotten the generators preplanned for. we need to do that ahead of time. it isn't a generator. it's getting that hospital back online and that may mean a generator, a electrician and a mechanic and getting thathospital back online so you don't have to evacuate it. and that's one of the things that i learned and continue to bring forth. that response based upon changing outcomes. the third piece, this is the piece i've seen in much of what have you been trying to get in testimony, it's much of what you've been writing about. is what is recovery? we keep talking about long term recovery and keep trying to build it. i'm not sure all the pieces understand what we're trying to   do and i certainly recognize that the stafford act all by itself will not achieve what we need to achieve but if we don't have some focal point that says, this is where we're going, then i think we get lost in our housing programs. we get lost in these solutions 'cause they're not really tied to that outcome. so i use and it's a very simplistic approach but it helps me guide an outcome that i can articulate and begin looking at the variety of resources we have at the federal level to support state. and that is re-establishing a tax base.in a community within a time frame that i would say no greater than five years that equals or exceeds that tax base prior to the event. and this is recognizing you don't want to just take five years but in an event like katrina where we have so much rebuilding to take place, that it's sometimes say it may be a simplistic measure but having been in government most of my life tax bases is a good indicator of the health of the economy. it tell us how many homes we have. it tells me people are buying permits and buying cars and i can provide for the services   such as schools and other components and it gives me a chance to look at our programs that can come in such as hud dollars from community bloc development grant, training dollars that come from the department of labor, working with commerce and other groups and sba to make sure sometimes disasters happen as the community is pivoting economically and it doesn't make sense if you don't recognize just putting it back will not change the economic outcome and we still end up with a failure. so looking at something that may not be the best answer in allcases, but from the standpoint of being able to give us a focal point to start driving recovery not just merely the stafford act but where the community has their tax base intact and they can continue their services that we've been successful in the housing mission, getting schools open, providing public safety, setting the stage for business to thrive helps me articulate a view that says as much as we work as a team to respond to the governor and a disaster, it's not fema, we merely are   articulating on behalf of the president, the team approach of all of our federal agencies. that approach and recovery, which is to me one of the things that you cannot have a great response and not recover is still a failure. it give us a better opportunity to start looking at holistically what federal programs do we already have? what authorities do we already have? and even though fema may not have those programs, helping provide that focus of the stafford act, parts of the program doing what it can butalso bringing in the rest of the federal family to help a local government and a state re-establish that government, that tax base, which in turn is a reflection that we've been able to achieve the things such as housing, jobs, and maintaining the community infrastructure. >> well, let me say, mr. fugate, what you've just said is motor vehicle to my ears and the people i represent will be very grateful to hear a clear and passionate vision of what is needed and truly what has been   lacking for many years here. and your focus on citizens and empowering them to make decisions to make all of this much better even though these are very difficult challenges, whether it's hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes or great floods. your focus on results as opposed to process, i cannot tell you how happy that makes this senator. and your focus on, which issomething i had not even thought of and i really am challenged by what you just said about trying to define what recovery is 'cause i myself have searched for that and your focus on identifying it as restoring the tax base either 100% or 120% or being satisfied with 80% -- whatever we decide it is, at least it give us a goal a that we all know what we're working for and i think that is a very excellent vision that you've   outlined and i most certainly can appreciate the significance of the. let me ask you this question here on -- which i have to bring up to you and you know because it's a very -- a tough issue at home is the zone issue. can you take a moment to explain what a v zone is and how manywill be affected by this decision and why we're struggling right now with what we rebuild and what we don't rebuild because i'm going to press you -- i'm happy that fema released, i think, 60% of $33 million or so that we've got tied up in this issue that affects the building of fire stations, police stations along the coast of louisiana. but mississippi, all the coastal communities from texas to mississippi to florida are going to be affected and i understand   and i'm going to get a map of the united states with all the v zones on it so people can understand. you may find yourself in one of these v zones and if a tornado comes, senator burris, and destroys areas in the v zones, the reimbursement that your community thinks they may be getting from the federal government is not necessarily going to happen. so i'd like mr. fugate to take a minute and i'm going to press you on how we can try to resolve this for our state but go ahead.>> madam chair, v zone is a velocity zone. it refers to and the flood insurance program in determining risk. that these are areas that have the highest risk. and that we have had as a policy within the nation to direct new growth away from the most vulnerable, most hazardous areas. that's a good policy. it makes sense. the challenge, though, however as we go back and remap and identify these areas, we're oftentimes finding that we have   many communities that were built in the v zone and historically are there and as we had developed our policy of passively directing construction out of there and again, not wanting to put new growth there but when you had a disaster, if something was damaged there we would relocate. well, there are probably opportunities in a small event where we had only a few homes that relocation would make sense. but when you're dealing with thechallenges we find across the gulf coast and other places that when you look at the new data that would suggest it's a high velocity or a high risk area, using the passive approach of rebuilding but allowing repairs to damage buildings but mitigating really didn't recognize that we still have to ask the question that as good stewards we don't want to promote growth in a hazardous area but if it's already there   can we not look at engineering and you've come back where they do a lot more active engineering to protect property that we would look at as being in a vulnerable zone. so i think we're reaching a point where as we come back and we look at v zones we have the immediate issues you're facing right now in your district that we are working under our current rules and regulations. but also looking at as we go forward, is it time to recognizethat there are many places along coastal communities that are going to face the same challenge in a disaster that we have to recognize it if we're going to allow a repair to occur if we mitigate, why would a destroyed building not also be considered the same factor and should we not be looking at if we can engineer a solution that keeps the public safe, reduces the future damages, does not commit to new growth in these areas but allows those historical   communities to rebuild better. and this will again be through your leadership and through the process of congress looking at reauthorization that we want guidance on. but i think we have to recognize that far too many areas that a passive approach of relocation only does not provide options that communities need to be able to continue as you pointed out numerous times doing an alternative project for a fire station far away from the community it's supposed to protect doesn't make any sense.>> okay. and i want the public to understand the significance of this issue. right now we have communities that have been in place for hundreds of years that are vibrant communities, vital communities that are shipping communities that have been designated as v zones. the current law says fema will -- you can repair your home -- you can repair your home but we won't build a fire station. we won't build a post office. we won't build a library so the   question then how viable of a community can you remain without a fire station, without a police station, without a library and that is a big question. and when this map is put up, which i don't have today, that's going to show all the v zones in the country and how many millions of people, millions and millions and millions of people live in v zones, which is in this senator's state and my senator's state i can promise you this is going to be a majordebate on this reauthorization of flood insurance. as you know i have a hold on that bill. that hold is going to remain until this issue gets resolved in a way that i believe or my committee -- you know, i'm only one senator but this committee is going to work very closely with you to find a rational approach which is part of what motivated me to go to the netherlands because i think they have an extremely rational approach to this issue which is a whole different system we won't get into in this hearing   but we will have some more hearings on that subject. i've been joined by my ranking member and i'd like to recognize him now because as i was pointing out, he and i have

.. moi   kim en and explained what capabilities of the mabey requesting and then summarized the table top exercise.i would tell you that the biggest shortfall of this current hurricane season probably is in the brigade structure with the national guard because the brigades deploying. even though it is a shortfall in certain regions and it's not a short fall across the nation's it's a matter of reallocating forces and the national guard is working closely right now with the state general to identify the forces that can fill the shortfall so the brigade structure was one area.   another was the number of rotary wing aircraft that could be depleting. again we looked across the states and there's plenty of assets available. it's identifying those in advance who would back up to in the states and on top of that we looked up the active component both army air force marines working with coast guard through dhs to see where the assets would be available as rotary wing would be called in to the emergency. the last area that leavitt mention that is of concern to usand we worked closely last week with u.s. transportation command, dhs, fema, health and human services and veterans administration is aeromedical deactivation. and i did we have improved greatly since the last hurricane season on the ability to identify patients that may be moved, how to receive them on the outbound end and the problem i think that we will face and we have brought about and discuss it at great length is the release time of the patients at   local and state level because if you wait until the last moment we can only move so many patients so we are trying to have defense cordon in officers working closely with minister fugate's federal coordinating officer is to talk with locals and give them that time line and say if you make the decision and 40 hours years the number of patients we can still get aircraft in. >> i'm going to ask my staff of the next hearing to design a chart along the gulf coast fromtexas to new york and indicate how many nursing home patients live with than 30 miles of the coast and by going to provide those numbers for you because as you know in katrina we had a very unfortunate incident of dozens of patients drowned in those nursing homes. and of course, it was quite traumatic for the families as well as the victim's obviously. but i don't think people   realize, like senator gramm just said, how many people live near this coast. and not everyone that lives near the coast has an automobile, not everyone is well, not everyone is strong enough or young enough to move out. they've got to have help moving out or be wealthy enough to afford the several thousand dollars at a minimum that it costs to leave your home forseveral days even if you managed to just find shelter in a tent there is some expense associated with this. and i just don't think people have an idea of this that have not recently gone through what some of our states have gone through, and lighting that you have identified this meant that situation as something the national guard and northcom can   be very helpful because as you know, states normally governors might have one helicopter that move them around but we don't have helicopters that move like all the citizens of around so it would be helpful to have these duralast it's being able to do this evacuation. did you have a comment or question? >> very quickly. general, it's not a question of lack of capacity in terms of overall numbers for the guard. it's just the resources may not be in the right spot; is thatcorrect? >> yes. >> i hear that recruiting retention as pretty good right now? >> they are over strength right now. >> how important is the guard and assistance in terms of the different agencies involved? how important as the guard -- what role do they play? >> i can't talk for the national guard being eight title x satloff search right now serving its northern command the iger opening guard so i will talk   about my experiences from the past but they are the first responders in the fire departments, emergency responders and the governor and so they are going to be their first and it behooves us at northcom to understand their capability, look at their response times because of the are successful with the local level that is less federal assets we have to put forward. >> you don't see need for this committee of the armed services committee to plus up anything, it is just to redistribute andreorganize what we have got? >> yes, senator. the congress has been very gracious with the department of defense and our ability to look at the ten essentials we use in the homeland as capabilities we respond to disasters and we are coming along very well and proving that capability especially in equipping of the ten essentials. >> thank you. mr. fugate, would you comment from your perspective on the national guard, the role of the national guard and do you find   the to the central? how do you want to position your organization with it and if you could do that in one minute or less or two and also comment on this idea that has been moving up around here about a sort of civilian ready reserve that could supplement both fema and the national guard in terms of trained personnel that could be called out in the event of acatastrophic disaster which obviously we can't maintain on call every day, but it would be nice to maybe have something like that. maybe we don't need it. maybe that is what the red cross is going to do or the role the national guard plays but if there is a gap, comment on the national guard and is ready reserve idea. >> thank you. national guard is a key component of any ability to respond to disasters. they are a force multiplier for   the local and state responders and again, after with your leadership upon my confirmation one of my first visits with general mckinley having worked closely with my tag knowing that relationship and again, we have a very strong statewide mutually system and we leverage that national guard so that as the unit's rotate in and out we have capability and identify with other states and in addition there's a lot of work done within the tax to make surethings such as joint operation center training are ready to go and support each other so i think is a good team and it is a key component of the national defense strategy but best important they are the first of the assets on the governor's authority and those governors can request from other state governors additional guard units as part of their authority managing a disaster. as far as the reserve component there's actually requirements that have been provided in the reformat for the bill and take   existing structures and build more professional response force and provide more training capabilities within our reserve force and so we are looking at that. as far as a standing reserve, that would be something i would like to further research plan think there are elements of that we are seeing in some of the programs where we are not creating so much a formal research process but building communities response teams at the training and in many casesit is building capabilities that are more adequately leveraged at the local level by enhancing through community emergency response team through the capitol of these people stand ready to help in their neighborhoods and calamities when disaster strikes. >> thank you. general, i have one more question for you and then one more for mr. fugate and we are going to move to the next panel and a minute. brandt you all did your   assessment of the joint task force were the significance of particularly the coast. all of the coast have port assets, port assets that of course must be maintained not just for the benefit of those communities but in the nation's economy depends and in some measure you could say the world's economy depends on the continued operations of these major ports. many of them obviously if you start from houston and work yourway up are many major airports that can be affected. and we saw when katrina hit one of the largest by volume port in the nation was shot down a long period of time and gas and oil operations of the gulf coast came precariously close. had retek hit houston, which it   did not, it hit close to houston, it's, you know, it was very interesting as someone might want to write what could have happened to the price of oil and gas had both the port of new orleans and port of houston and almost all offshore operations at that point would have been shot down for quite some time. that didn't happen but it would be an interesting research project. but what is your responsibility to the ports keeping them open and how did you will discuss that at your exercise and couldyou testify to that point, please? >> madam chairman, again, working with fema and i will give you an example what we did during hurricane ike last year we worked with coast guard through dhs and fema and fema requested an fabius ship be deployed into the gulf and the port of galveston was devastated by hurricane ike and there was 100 obstacles in the channel,   and so the uss nassau was deployed there. we have any given day two ships on the east coast and to on the west coast primarily amphibious ships that can take on the tight q1 load, vessels out the back that can respond and we had navy seabees on board that went ashore and worked with locals. again working at the request of fema. >> you said you have two ships on the east and west coast.do you have any on the gulf coast? >> i'm not at this point but the two on the east coast would respond if you had enough notice? >> yes, ma'am, if we've received a notice from fema we are prepared to move those and as we move those we are looking at the path to try to get as close into a port as we can in the storm passed. >> last question, mr. fugate and i'm going to submit several about pets, about community   disaster loans and other things, trailers, alternative housing, but because my time is short and the season is now in a storm will hit this debris removal for local communities is a nightmare and it causes and medicated pain and suffering on the part of local officials that one of the first things they have to do is remove debris. and we had just one headache after another about fema's rulesand regulations that when something like this, if the tree limb was more than 5 inches around you got reimbursed at 100%. if it was 4 inches you got 80% and if it was 2 inches, you got 30%. i make saturating a little bit but for the purposes of this hearing what has been changed about debris removal and a catastrophic or major storm? what hope could you give these local officials that that is one of their immediate headaches   torian to clear the streets, clear the roads so that people can get back? obviously with debris no one can move, that has to be done. and it seems to me we keep making mistake after mistake after mistake. so what can you do as the fema director to put a system in place that's clear, easy-to-use and cost-effective? we are not asking the federal government to pick up 100%, butwe are asking the federal government to have clear rules and regulations so the local officials can actually begin the recovery because without the debris removal there is no recovery. >> madame chair, diprete and emergency protective measures are those things i think we have to make sure we know what the outcome is so we can get there quickly and that is to get debris where we can get access and the community and number two we get the debris upsweep   prevent the problems it creates and begin the recovery. there were some successful programs, they were pilots i would like to revisit that provide a better incentive financially to the local governments and states who went ahead and developed the plan said they had many of these questions answered and they knew what they were going to but i think it is also incumbent upon us to make sure guidance is providing clear direction without being a process that is a difficult as a local officialthe only way i can understand is to hire former fema officials to explain the rules i am now having to seek reimbursement from the federal government in my time of need. >> thank you very much. thank you. the panels have been wonderful. i wish we could spend more time but we will follow up. thank you. if the second panel would come forward. [inaudible conversations]   [inaudible conversations]if you all would take your seats, please. thank you very much for joining us. i would like to introduce all of you and then in the order i do so you're asked to proceed with your opening remarks. our first witness today on the second panel will be george   foresman. mr. foresman co-chairs the advisory board for the corporate crisis response officers association. he's also the former undersecretary for preparedness and emergency response at the department of homeland security. the corporate crisis response offices association is a new organization chartered to identify train and engage crisis response officers and newcorporate positions as local contact points for the public sector. so i am as the chair of this committee and you heard mr. fugate say we look to the private-sector for partners. we want to not only look to the private sector for partners but i want to look to the private sector for better technologies, operations and efficiencies that we can of course incorporate into the government response and we thank you very much for your testimony today. we are anxious to hear your   views and perspectives. next we will hear from armand mascelli vice president for operations at the american red cross. mr. mascelli is responsible for cord meeting red cross response to major domestic disasters for managing organizations disaster logistics' technology and human resource systems. i'm very interested i understand the red cross since katrina has gone through a major reorganization and we are looking forward to hearing someof the outcomes today. and finally, last but certainly not least this is janet durden, president of north west united way serves as coordinating council person for louisiana 211 but this is a nationwide emergency response system that i think can be very helpful in all of the issues we have talked about this morning. so, mr. foresman, if you will   begin. thank you. >> senator, thank you very much -- [inaudible] >> can you pull the microphone a little bit closer, there you go. >> normally might booming voice works wonders. senator landrieu, thank you for the opportunity to be with you this morning and talk about the important work of the community partnership. we've provided written testimony respectfully requested it be included in the record. the ready come into partnership is an initiative of corporatecrisis response officers association six to identify and implement best practices that helps support improvements in public and private sector response and recovery efforts. this initiative is grassroots developed by a coalition of public and private sector leaders who recognize better prepared netz for emergencies and disasters could and so we depend on actions of the federal government or in fact government alone. this initiative is centered on community-based approach that seeks to further galvanize the resources of the public and private sectors to address large   skill crisis in the community. these two sectors depend on each other on day-to-day life of the community as they collaborate how to improve economic competitiveness, schools and infrastructure. the partnership operates under a tenant that the dependency should be just as strong if not stronger during a crisis. it today even falling katrina and countless other disasters widespread cultural belief remains in visions crisis response and recovery during the first critical 72 hours has beengovernment centric with private-sector engagement limited to those for-profit companies and not-for-profit organizations to deliver essential services like electricity, phone, degree remove or disaster aid. as a result of broad private-sector is viewed as part of the victim population rather than a potential community resources to be leveraged to tva suffering and speed up recovery and communities return to normal. the r. dee community partnership seeks to give local political and business leaders as well as   emergency managers and additional low-cost tool to improve private sector integration for postage and crisis management efforts while simultaneously acknowledging it must be accomplished in a manner that complements existing government centered community preparedness initiatives. specific to the challenges we face the up coming hurricane season america's newest fema administrator greg fugate provide a compelling update on the readiness for the upcoming season. i cannot think of a better ormore qualified professional to beat fema. i will also offer as someone associated with the field more than a quarter century critic and his management team are collectively the most diverse qualified and hands on experience group to occupy the seats of the agency. this has bolstered by the talented group and organization the department of homeland security. it gives me optimism and should give optimism to americans the federal government is continuing to perform and improve its ability to support communities and states dealing with   emergency disasters of all kinds. but to be fair however even with this great leadership team the federal government is but one part of america's prepared this equation. federal readiness shouldn't imply national readiness other parts, local and state government nonprofit, private sector and american citizens have equally compelling important roles in all aspects of communities. in all aspects of communities deal just government actions we need to make sure the entire community is ready for thehurricane season. our recent work with private-sector to the flu outbreak provides anecdotal evidence to suggest pipe was sector prepared eckert and consistent and not necessarily like were made with government officials and communities where these businesses operate. even with heightened attention to nationwide pandemic planning over the past four years there's been surprised at the number of businesses large and small who find nothing at the assumption their local state and federal governments will and can do   everything in a crisis like a hurricane or pandemic appears at the front door. yet at the same time we have seen and of a hurricane preparedness efforts along the gulf coast and atlantic coast between local and state governments and private sector and in states such as florida. but unfortunately these are all replicate across all states will rebel to hurricane strike. in light of both we are left to conclude on the whole community preparedness with a mix of private and public collaborationand mutual dependence is lacking. this will create requirements for government and federal government. this committee knows it preparedness efforts leaders make the difference. business and government making political and economic business case crisis prepare this is essential to the fiscal and economic survival in light of today's communities states and businesses there's little margin for error in terms of the efficiencies applied how we respond to and recover from disasters. the community's partnership has seen the value of businesses   large and small designating corporate crisis response of the search you work hand-in-hand with government in preparation for and response and recovery to a crisis. these predicted contact points along with collaboration enhanced because when something bad happens to write public officials are talking at the right time about, mr. mascelli,am i pronouncing that correct? >> senter, thank you. it's an honor to testify before you on behalf of the american red cross. we appreciate this opportunity to share the details and ability to respond to the challenges that may face the american people during the coming months. before i begin my testimony i would like to take the opportunity to thank the new fema administrator for his work in florida and express   appreciation of the red cross for his support to the disaster preparedness response efforts in the state. for more than 125 years the red cross has provided released to the victims of disasters help families and individuals prevent prepare for and respond to emergencies from single-family house fires to large-scale disasters like hurricanes to red cross works to provide essential life savings sustaining services to those in need. we shelter, feet, providecritical supplies and emotional support to those impacted by disasters in communities across the country. we rely heavily on generous contributions from the public including donations of time, money and blood. today the report on preparations for the upcoming hurricane season. our organization on the local and national level operates at constant cycle of responding to disasters preparing for the future. red cross regularly participates in activities to build capacity   to partner to plant prepare exercise and evaluate our -- organization. if completed a detailedassessment of communications equipment inventory and verify their readiness of our nation wide disaster fleet. the national shelter system is ready and now contains shelter locations and capacity information for over 55,000 buildings that could be potentially used to shelter across the country. the national shelter system is used for planning and operational decisions and includes openings and overnight populations on a daily basis.   we have made the national shelter system available to fema and to all the states free of charge. and it's also currently being used by 12 other national non-government partners. stephan for disaster operations is also a critical function requires that financed planning. while we focus on the use of local volunteers and when possible we also have a cadre of people trained and available to leave their communities to go todisasters. that number is now 90,000 which is a substantial increase from 23,000 we had available for hurricane katrina. these disaster workers are trained for specific jobs and we are now in the process of evaluating the availability for disasters over the next several months. since hurricane katrina is a result of several after action imports including one from the senate committee on homeland security and government affairs the red cross is focus more   resources on coordination with federal, state and local government with support from fema we currently about four times read cross representatives in ten of the fema regional offices and we also have two additional staff working at fema headquarters. i've also asked the staff members to work with a national disaster housing task force. during the last few we've been working with governments, state governments and improving planning for example the redcross and state of louisiana working towards a single unified sheltering plan discussions are continuing with state department of social services and governor's office of homeland security emergency preparedness about mutual logistics and sheltering for people with critical transportation needs. we recently participate in the state of florida and emergency major disaster exercise and with fema with a table top exercise category four hurricane   affecting savannah, georgia. we also were dissipated recently in a cab and a little exercise that dealt with a category three making landfall near new york city. identifying new and strengthening existing partnerships continued to be a strong priority of my organization. on the local level, chapters partner with local community faith based and civic organizations and we've also stepped up efforts to ensurecommunities to 11 organizations of current disaster information. i would like to acknowledge to ms. durden the good work united way has been doing in this area. in addition we cultivate its strength in partnerships with such diverse groups as help nationwide to national association of colored people to the legal services corporation in the buddhist foundation and an additional we've worked closely with national association interpreters,   translators to national virtual translation center, national council of la raza, national disability rights network and save the children. we've also worked with pat rights groups such as u.s. humane society. seeing my time is short i will move on to say that the red cross is also involved and continuing to improve","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 5, 2009 6:00pm-6:30pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

789 chrysler and 1350 general motors dealerships face terminations. these dealerships employ over   100,000 people. these people deserve more. the chrysler dealership terminations are particularly harsh. these 789 dealers were given 26 days to wind down. also, chrysler's refused to buy back vehicles, parts and special equipment. no manufacturer has ever done this. just four days after chrysler dealers received their termination letters, media reports said that chrysler already was planning to re-enter some of the very markets that they were abandoning.with respect to gm, the effects were actually broader. yesterday, gm delivered to my dealership a quote, participation letter which every gm dealer must sign. even though i am one of the quote, go forward dealers, i will have to make significant changes that could threaten the viability of my dealership and my employees. actually, gm's letter is a 24 page binding legal contract. senator snowe referred to a 12-page agreement. mine is 24. if i sign it, i will be   committing my business to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars that i know about today and committing to millions of dollars of potential financial obligations in the future. i will also be subjecting my business to sales performance standards that are not specified in the contract. even worse, gm can alter the terms of these requirements at any time at its sole discretion. the final blow, i must waive any right of protest to any action taken by the manufacturer.the contract actually says this document shall be null and void if the dealer changes any term or provision or if it is not executed by the dealer on or before june 12th. that's next friday. that's seven days from now. so my choice is this. sign the completely one-sided open-ended legal document, give up all my basic rights as a dealer or face the consequences of cancellation of my franchise during the pending bankruptcy. the other 4,000 go forward dealers have the same choice.   this really is no choice at all. it's a classic example of opportunistic and overreaching behavior by the manufacturers. that's exactly what has prompted the enactment by legislatures of all 50 states of franchise laws that govern the relationship between dealers and the manufacturers. no other manufacturer has forced dealers to sign such an onerous agreement. this is not necessary for gm's viability and federal funds are being used to empower gm to do this.this is a manipulation of the bankruptcy process to eviscerate the state franchise laws. laws that inject balance in the inherently one-sided economic relationship between a dealer and the manufacturer and that also provide consumers with a reliable, convenient and competitive retail auto network. so we urge the following. first, the executive branch should provide sufficient debtor in possession financing to enable chrysler to buy back the parts, the inventory, the   manufacturer specific tools from the terminated dealers. this is standard practice in our industry. second, the terminated chrysler dealers need more time to make an orderly transition. no manufacturer has ever imposed such onerous terms on such a tight deadline. third, the terms of gm's go forward agreements must be changed. no manufacturer has ever imposed such outrageous terms in dealer operator agreements. fourth, franchise laws of the 50 states should remain intact andapply with full force and effect once chrysler and gm emerge from bankruptcy. since this entire bankruptcy has been negotiated by the executive branch, congress should intervene if necessary to make sure these actions are taken. i thank you for holding this important hearing and thank you for the opportunity to testify. >> thank you very much. i will start the questioning and again, we will do it in order of appearance and that's more taxing for some than for others.   first of all, i just want to clear something up for the record. i got a note saying that some of the press or some others felt that pete lopez, i have been rude to you by interrupting you. i don't think in view of our relationship, that's a fair thing to say. however, for the record, let me just say that a lot of people come here and testify for the first time and they have a fairly lengthy statement, and iwasn't sure -- i wanted you to get through the parts you wanted to get through in five minutes. >> that's okay. i didn't take it that way. absolutely not. i'm delighted to be here. >> mr. lopez, both chrysler and gm have terminated their franchise agreements with you, correct? >> yes, they have. >> can you wind down your chrysler dealership in 26 days? >> no way. there's no way. i don't think you can do a personal bankruptcy in that   amount of time. i have -- i'm down to probably 48 cars, 24 of each, and by the way, in february, i was called by chrysler and i want to tell you the conversation. the representative calls me and says i need you to take 35 cars, and i said i can't do that, i'm not going to put myself out of business. she said well, you have to, we're in this together. and i said no, we're not in thistogether. i will go through my inventory and i will take what i can, i'll try to help. she calls back and she says you need to take 23, we can live with 23. i said well, i can live with nine. i will take nine. i'll do my share. and she said well, i'll have to call detroit. i said well, just give me that number, let me call them. and she calls me back in five minutes, says well, the nine will do. and i wasn't going to let her put me out of business, just like the gentleman beside me. i have employees that i care about, they have been with me   from the beginning and it's just -- it's unbelievable how we have been treated. there is no rhyme or reason. in west virginia, there's a dealership that sold 19 cars last year and he has his franchise in his front yard, and he takes -- they take spencer auto group. there's no rhyme or reason. >> mr. press, were you an autodealer like mr. lopez, would you know how to close down a dealership in 26 days? can you tell me how you do it? >> well, we are nae the process of working through a bankruptcy of chrysler corporation and not too many more days. it's very difficult, it's strenuous. the fact of the matter is that in our situation, we did not plan or have in our minds the desire to have a bankruptcy. >> i wish you would answer my question. >> okay. >> would you know how to do it?   could you do it in 26 days if you had to? >> i would have to find a way to do it, yes, sir, i would. i would have to find a way to achieve the shut-down required within that time period as we are being required within our time period that's given to us. yes. >> mr. lopez, on january 9th, i think it was, of 2009, that being this year, mr. press,according to all reports, including newspapers, within the business, did indicate what you said. that is, got a lot of people on the telephone, said you got to buy 78,000 cars. >> absolutely. >> to keep us going. >> absolutely. >> you've already said that you got that, but what kind of pressure does that put on you? >> well, of course, you know, i   said to her at the time, our chrysler representative, i said you know, i am not, right now i'm sitting on six months' worth of inventory. for me to take the kind of cars she wants me to take, i'm not going to put myself out of business. i think i'm a better businessman than that. i know how to run my store. i know what my store can sell and what we will sell, and i just didn't want to put that kind of money on my floor plan and i did help.we're a small dealer, like i said. i went through the inconvenieved told her i would take nine. i didn't have to take any. she demanded we take 35, then the 23 and then the nine and that's what we did. then the same thing the next month. >> did gm threaten any action if you did not sign their so-called wind-down agreement? did you feel coerced or threatened in any way?   >> no, sir. gm, we did not have that. in fact, gm has a gentleman that i've dealt with, tony napoleon, who has just done a great job with us. the letter you're talking about as far as signing by the 12th of this month, we just got that yesterday and i have not had a chance to look at it. my understanding, if we don't sign it, we automatically are gone. and by the way, gm sent us paperwork that said we had anappeal process. and i called mr. napoleon, who is our district manager, and he told me exactly what to do and how to do it, and i've done it. now, my understanding, there is no appeal. there is no appeal whatsoever. so we're all left, you know, from what i hear about the letter, if we sign it, we sign all our rights away. at one time we had a thing in   west virginia where consumers, we wanted to video the closing so everything was above board, and i think the attorney general ruled on it that we took away our consumers' rights and i don't think you can do that. that's what they're doing to us. they're taking our rights away. >> thank you, sir. senator hutchison? >> thank you, mr. chairman. mr. whatley, did you get a call from chrysler earlier this yearasking you to buy inventory to help the cpanm@ rrarrrrk%รก@ @ '   the assurance that you have given to me and you have said that you plan to give. it's not forthcoming to them. so could you explain how it is that you are going to take this inventory from the dealers, youhave mentioned 89% or 90%, but that isn't happening, at least they don't see it. so could you help me with that? >> yes, i will. thank you. >> and perhaps help them. >> of course. we have established a program after we learned of the bankr t bankruptcy that would allow us to redistribute the cars from the affected dealers to those dealers that are going forward. as well as parts and their   special tools. the process will begin when two things occur. number one, the terminations take effect, because they're not terminations -- the effective date has not occurred yet. the cars are not ready to be taken from the inventory of the affected dealers. and second, a floor plan source has to be put in place for the incoming new dealers. again, we started that process within ten days and established a relationship with gmac.they're putting a floor plan position as we speak. over 80% of the affected dealers have a floor plan available now to take these vehicles. >> do they know that, because i'm not hearing that from one dealer that they understand that there is a plan in place that this inventory will be taken. >> the dealers do know that. it's been -- they've been called. we have a log, a phone log confirming the discussion with every dealer.   e-mails have been sent. the dealers who have agreed to have the redistribution occur are getting a daily status and we have now 97% of the vehicles committed by the dealers going forward to relieve these dealers of this inventory and about 51% of the parts. >> mr. whatley or mr. lopez, does that meet with your understanding? >> we have had no contact with the business center whatsoever until monday, june 1, after your office had called them and kindof rattled them. i did get a call then that said rest assured, we will try to come up with a plan to remove your inventory after june the 9th. i have seen no reports. i have seen -- i have not talked to anyone except with one phone call at your office did seem to generate from them. i've had no other contact whatsoever. i also have the official terms here of the agreement. it says that chrysler will assist in selling cars, they will request new dealers to buy   cars and that chrysler is only facilitating the sale of the inventories by attempting to identify potential buyers. on the contract that we sign and send in, it says dealer understands and acknowledges chrysler has no obligation and is not responsible for any action or agreement. >> there's a disconnect here, mr. press. let me add one thing to this.in waco, texas, a town of 122,000, all three chrysler dealerships are being closed. now, the view is that another dealer is going to come in from out of state, not someone who is a part of that community, and new dealerships are going to be created in waco because there would be no dealers for chrysler in this town of 122,000.   help me understand what appears to be an effort to change the contracts with the dealers that are in place to make better contracts with new dealers coming in. that's what it appears. am i wrong? >> well, actually, first of all, i would like to address mr. whatley afterwards. i am sure we can take care of his issues and as i told you, wewill be redistributing the vehicles. i can't understand why he did not receive a phone call. we have a proof of log that he did. we will work through that. i apologize. second, we are not changing the contracts of dealers. this is a case where we are trying to bring first of all, all three brands under one roof, because by trying to run three separate brands and channels and dealer bodies, we have gone broke. we can't do that any longer.   second, there are other reasons for the dealer actions that have been taken. within that, bringing the three brands under one roof. we want to do it in a way that we bring the performers along that will allow us the best return on all of our investment. there are some dealers whose performance is substandard. in this case, we have set and the dealers realize there's a minimum sales responsibility based on market share, that they should receive in their town. in the case of the dealers thathave been -- that have not been taken forward, we will lose -- last year we lost 55,000 units of sales in the deficient sales positions. that's about $1.5 billion in revenue. it's better in the short term for us where we have dealers that may not be able to perform to the market standard to replace them at some point with a stronger dealer. the dealer is our customer in that market. we realize that. but they're our only customer. if they're not able to sell to   the level that we need to generate our revenue, then obviously, and they're substandard from average, obviously we need to make a stronger dealer body. >> my time is up. >> may i respond to something? >> mr. chairman, my time is up. would you like for him to answer that question? mr. lopez. >> please, but briefly. >> okay. they were talking about the twoparts of the dodge and the chrysler, the vans. one is a dodge and one is a town and country. you've got a dodge version that is less expensive than the town and country. we're all under the same roof. we didn't ask them to build those two different vehicles. it doesn't make any difference what they build, we sell them. >> thank you, sir. senator clobuchar?   >> thank you very much, mr. chairman. i want to make clear, everyone here wants you to succeed. they want general motors to succeed. they want chrysler to succeed. the dealers want you to succeed and one of my focuses here is just to make this process as fair as possible. some of our dealers want more time and then some of our dealers feel that they should be able to stay in business because they're profitable. mr. henderson, i do appreciate that general motors has this appeals process and that you have been taking it seriously. i know that some decisions havebeen reversed. is that correct? and what i don't understand with the interrelationship here with the letters that are june 12th, because some of our dealers have appealed, they have done everything right. they want to go through this process. they think the facts are on their side but then if they get this letter that says they have to be done by june 12th, are they out then? can they appeal? >> thank you, senator. let me see if i can't explain both the process for winding down as well as the process for continuing.   the reasons for the dates, in this case june 12th, has to do with the fact that we're a company in bankruptcy as well, and that means that we march to a timetable, and i will try to make it clear in a moment why there's an aggressive timetable, but we march to a timetable to try to make sure we understand which dealers come with us to the new general motors and which dealers are not able to. let me talk about the process of the wind-down. we have gone out to our dealers, as i said, almost half thedealers signed it the day they received the wind-down agreement and i respect the fact, it's 12 pages but many dealers said we accept it because we structured it with a set of benefits that were overwhelmingly better than they had if they did not sign it. that's the reason why -- we had 85% of our dealers, for example, sign up for it in canada within five days. >> i want to get to chrysler. my real question here on behalf of my dealers is can they still appeal? >> yes. yes, ma'am. >> how will they be able to do that when it' june 12th?   >> we are actually working around the clock. we have a team of people dedicated -- >> they should appeal before june 12? >> absolutely, every day. we are dealing with these every single day. >> the other question i had, we have just to give one example, we have examples everywhere, but we have been told this is one dealer that is located, location, location, location, which when we talked to you, that is key. they are located between toyota and nissan on the road near the mall of america, 150,000 cars aday. one of the most profitable dealers in minnesota. yet this is one, they're appealing, that has been decided to be closed down. i just want to have you remember that image in your mind. my second question really is of you, mr. press. you don't have any kind of appeals process. is there any way you can institute an appeals process? at chrysler? >> our case may be different. i'm not familiar with general motors. what we've done is created a new company that will be formed at the end of this process and the dealers that will be in that new company have been identified   from all of the dealers that were with the old company. in regards to that, we have a limited period of time from when the bankruptcy was filed to when the new company has to be finalized. if we do not have a finalized dealer organization, the new company will not be formed and the company will have to liquidate. we also, in terms of the process, the strategic market representation actions, the consolidation of single brands,were done from a point of view not as a mistake or what a dealer has or hasn't done. it isn't up to an appeal from a dealer. it's a strategic market decision of what the new company wants their dealer body to look like. >> we have many dealers who invested $5 million, who got the cars when you guys asked them to get the cars. they clearly feel they haven't been treated fairly here. one of the things, as i look at what can we do to help them right now, clearly the time   would help them. some type of an appeals process would help them. and i would say the other thing is that i understand that you agreed to purchase these vehicles. is that right? and to repurchase them to put them out on the networks but one of their concerns is that while you're going to take possession, the dealership will still have to pay interest on the loans used to purchase the vehicles and in short, they are going to continue to hold most of the risk. i wondered what assurances that you can give to the dealers thatchrysler will actively market these vehicles and what's going to happen to them. that's what they're concerned, they're left really holding the risk. >> of course. i understand that. i hope at some point i will get a question i can defend my comment about buying cars but i will do that later. i respect the time of the committee. with regard to this repurchase, the redistribution agreement, obviously it's in our best interest to control these cars so they don't get in the used car markets, they don't deteriorate, used car values.   we want very much. second, we have stopped making cars for the last 30 days, for 30 days and probably for the next 15 days. our inventories are the lowest they have ever been since we kept records in our company. we have plenty of homes of dealers who want to buy these cars and 97% of them have been committed for. after june 9th, the new -- the position of our new gmac relationship we'll be able to take the cars, by the middle of june, we'll have the cars for those dealers who have signedthe agreement to allow us to take them, they'll be gone. for the dealers that haven't signed an agreement, as soon as they do, those cars will be gone by the first weefk july. we have to control these cars and that's a commitment that we have made and we said we could continue -- >> the parts? the parts? >> we already have 51% of the parts committed. we continue to work on those parts. by the same time period, we plan to have those accomplished as well. >> thank you.   >> thank you. senator? >> thank you, mr. chairman. we spent a fair amount of time understanding process. i want to dig a little deeper there. let me start with mr. henderson. mr. henderson, just in terms of how you got to this list of dealers survive, this list of dealers don't, how did you get to that list? did you form a committee at general motors or something likethat? >> we went back and looked at history, senator, of both sales effectiveness as well as customer service and a series of other matrix as well but those two would be the most important in terms of evaluating it, not just simply one year but going back multiple years. >> who headed that up at general motors? give me a name. >> his name was ben marklinave. >> what relationship did you have then with the auto task force, the administration, as you were working your way through this process? >> the auto task force was not   involved in the process at all. >> were they made aware of your process or did you surprise them like you surprised the dealers? >> they were aware of the process but they were not involved in it. no. >> did they ever see any of the documents that were produced? >> we have not shared a list, for example. we don't have a list of which dealers we have both agreed -- we have decided to wind down, nor have they seen a list of those dealers that would go forward. so, you know, they're involved in","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 5, 2009 2:30am-3:00am EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

that, i think that the sooner we can deal with that, the better off this country is going to be in general. with that, mr. chairman, i look forward to the testimony of herbal i son, and i look forward to a quick confirmation. . >> thank you.@@@@@@@ @ @   opening comments at all on the case of our nominee? >> i think -- thank you, mr. chairman. i would just like to thank you, mr. allison, for being here, mr. allison, for being here, willingness to serve. i unfortunately have an agriculture committee hearing i have to go to. but i want to stress as i was coming in, i heard senator tester say this, how important small business and community banks are to this recovereffort. we have had a number of conversations here with treasury secretary on that subject. we have a case of our own in colorado relating to a bank failure of one of our agricultural banks that is -- that is under review by the treasury department. and my perspective is the same as senator tester's, which is that until we begin to see this involvement beginning to take place at the local level, our public is still going to wonder   how we're spending our taxpayers' money. i want to underscore that for you. i'm sure you know that and i look forward to hearing your thoughts about that and to working with you as a member of this committee. >> thank you, senator. >> thank you, mr. chairman. >> thank you, senator, very much. and mr. allison, welcome, again, to the committee and we'll be happy to hear your opening comments. >> thank you very much, chairman dodd and other members of the committee. i'm honored to be before you today. first, wasn't to thank presidi tobama and treasury geithner to asking know serve. and the staff and your time for acquainting me with your perspectives on the crisis and the measures to address it. before i review my background and my plans for the office of financial stability if confirmed, i want to thank my wife, again, of 35 years and my sons john and andrew for their steadfast support support over those years. i began my career as the chairman said as an officer in the u.s. navy, spending four years in active duty including a   year in vietnam. after attending business school, i joined merrill lynch and spent 28 years leaving as president in 1999. the merrill i held many positions in finance, human resources and investment banking and capital markets and general management. in 1998 i played a central role in unwinding long-term capital management, the hedge fund that a decade ago presented a systemic risk to our banking system. i learned from my experiences at merrill that the long-termsuccess of financial institutions includes sound corporate governances including independent checks and balances, tight control over risk and executive compensation geared to long-term performance on behalf of clients as well as shareholders. at merrill lynch i contributed to strengthening the governance practices in the 1990s. since leaving merrill lynch a decade ago i've led two other major financial institutions through transitions necessary for their long-term success. in 2002 i became chairman and   ceo of tiaa-creff, a leading retirement and asset management service. we adapted t ed ed the company changing climates. as a result, tiaa-cref is one of very few financial companies that carry aaa ratings. and during my tenure, the company became the first company in the fortune 100 to allow itsstakeholders an advisory role on executive compensation. in september of 2008 i was named ceo of the federal national mortgage association, as that company was placed into government conservatorship. the crisis that devastated fannie mae's liquidity and capital base also threatened millions of american homeowners with foreclosure. new management had to shift the company's focus from maximizing profit and market share to helping hard-pressed american families stay in their homes.   as a result fannie mae is the agent for the president's home affordable refinance and modification programs which offer financial relief to millions of americans. members of the committee, the financial stability program is essential to president obama's and secretary geithner's plans for recovery. our economy declined sharply last year, in part because credit stopped flowing. without access to credit, small businesses cannot buy the new equipment, raw materials andinventory that they need to expand. and larger businesses need well-functioning credit markets as they adjust to the changing nature of the global marketplace. if confirmed, i will keep in mind that the financial crisis isn't mainly about banks. it's about alleviating the real hardships americans are facing every day. i will strive to be a prudent investor on behalf of the american people. to protect the taxpayers who have entrusted us with so much of their money.   so, let me tell you what my top priorities will be if you decide to confirm me. first, i will carefully review the controls over managing the taxpayers' money. giving special attention to compliance with laws and directives, managing risks, and internal audits. i will work closely with the special inspector general, the government accountability office, the financial stability oversight board, the congressional oversight panel and the committees of congressto ensure the accountability and oversight that the american people demand. second, under the direction of secretary geithner, i will continually strive to maximize the effectiveness of financial stability programs, restoring soundness to financial institutions and liquidity to our markets. and, finally, as secretary geithner has directed, i will emphasize transparency and interaction with congress so that you and the american people will know what we're doing with their money, why we're doing it,   and how it's making a difference to our economy. members of the committee, let me close by thanking you for considering my nomination as assistant secretary of the treasury for financial stability. i was raised by a family that has always valued public service. my father spent much of his career as a special agent in the fbi. my dad's father worked in the u.s. department of agriculture here in washington, d.c. my mother's father was sheriff of sioux falls, south dakota,and my brother, george allison, with me today, retired with the rank of captain after 28 years in the u.s. navy. having started my own career in the navy, i'm honored and inspired by the opportunity to return to public service. thank you very much. >> thank you very, very much. in our conversation i didn't know that your dad had been in the fbi. my father was an fbi. >> really, really? >> in fact, his first post was in sioux falls, south dakota. long before i was born, by the way. i might have been raised there.   over the years. thank you. we are joined by mark warner, senator warner of virginia. mark, do you have any opening comments you'd like to make? >> senator tester told me since i was late i had to reserve my comments. >> well, john runs the show around here, so we appreciate it. let me start with some questions. i'm going to leave the clock off. i'll invite my colleagues sings there are three or four of us here to have a more informal conversation.if i start a line of questioning and you have a thought along the same line, jump right in here, so we make this in a way more cohesive in that sense. so many places to start. let me start with this. since t.a.r.p.'s inception the program's scope, size and complexity have dramatically increased. i made note of this in my opening comments when i noted the 12 separate initiatives under t.a.r.p. today. some of these interact with the federal reserve, some with the   fdic, some obviously with private investors as we discussed as well. i wonder if you could begin, i think some of this you mentioned in your steps, the initial steps, you intend to take, but i would like you to expand on this and how you would assure this committee and the public at large the effective management of such a complex program that involves already interaction with almost every other federal agency that's direct or indirectly involved with economic recovery in the country. and i wonder if you might sharethose thoughts. and i've been joined by my colleague from alabama and let me interrupt myself and ask my friend and colleague if he'd like to make opening comments. >> mr. chairman, i've been late. i've been in the appropriations committee meeting, and we had a very important hearing on this nomination here in the committee. i would ask that my opening statement be made part of the record. i might have a question in a few moments. >> okay. terrific. we just heard, by the way, that herb allison's father is an fbi   agent for many years. it's a timely connection. >> very good. he's got a presumption in his favor. >> thank you. why don't you begin with that. you've been involved with complex entities in the past. >> absolutely. >> obviously at merrill and fannie and tiaa-cref. give us the background. because it seems every time we turn around there's a new program with the t.a.r.p. program and it's getting more and more complex inunderstanding how the resources are being used. give us some sense of how you would approach this. >> yes, sir. thank you very much for the question. actually one of my first steps as i joined the treasury was to contact the special inspector general, neil barofsky, and ask to meet with him. we've been meeting every week since. i think he plays a very important role in protecting american taxpayers, and i want to do all i can to work with him going forward. as you well said, this is an extremely complex and very large   program. it requires vigilant control. one of my first acts will be to meet with our people in compliance as well as our own internal audit people. people in the legal area, to re-examine all of our controls over the financial stability programs. secondly, we are building our information systems even further so we can monitor the performance of each of these programs, monitor these controls. i'm having -- will have, wheni'm confirmed, weekly meetings with the management team to go over all those metrics. we're going to be inviting in members and meeting with the congressional oversight panel and the other oversight groups including the gao and seeking their guidance as well to make sure that this program is well controlled and highly transparent to all who have to oversee it. >> well, let me jump to the issue of foreclosures. there was an article in one of the leading newspapers in the country yesterday about concerns   over whether or not the foreclosure mitigation program, which we've been so actively involved in on this committee for the last several years, is working very well. we -- the administration is dedicated $50 billion of t.a.r.p. funds for foreclosure prevention mitigation through a loan modification program. most members of this committee strongly support that effort. we've had various ideas as to how this would work. and obviously when there are 23 of us up here trying to craft something, you get a lot ofdifferent ideas that can make up that decision, and all of us, i think, understand as well -- while we may debate about how many causes conflicted or contributed, rather, to this crisis, i think all agree that a major cause was, of course, the residential mortgage market, subprime lending, the predatory lending that went on, and so any effort to address all of this absolutely demands, insists, that we to everything we can to try to keep as many people in their homes. 10,000 a people a day with   foreclosure filings can every single day in this country and the numbers may increase in the coming weeks and months. so, the concern about whether or not this program will work very well or not raises two issues in my mind, given the apparent resistance on the part of servicers to participate in this program. first, we need good data on how many loans are being modified or refinanced under the -- in the hope for homeowners program. how many are being rejected forassistance in order to hold the receiver -- servicers accountable for their promises, and we need that data made public on a servicer-by-servicer basis. i wonder if you might commit to doing that very quickly. and secondly, there needs to be some process by which homeowners or consumers can raise concerns about the way the process is working. i have two thoughts on this. either creating an ombudsman in a sense that gives people an opportunity to understand all of this, dedicated loan   modification or programs we ought to ask the special inspector general to oversee compliance with foreclosure prevention programs. i wonder if you might share some thoughts. this goes to the heart of this in so many ways. if this fails and we're not making the kind of effort -- not only making the effort, but iffest is not succeeded in this area and we end up with a new wave of foreclosure coming in, as we could, swamping the kind of efforts being made. this thing is beginning to gain traction. things are beginning to improve.confidence and optimism clearly seem to be getting better, and what none of us want to see is this all of a sudden stalling out and falling back. if it does, to regain that momentum again i think will be a lot harder than it was in the initial effort. so, this is a critical moment, it seems to me, not to lose that momentum, however slight it may be, but certainly momentum heading in the right direction for the first time, in months in my view. but failure in this area i think would throw us back in ways that i think would make it very   difficult to recover. i'd be very interested in ideas how we can -- we don't want to wait weeks or months whether or not it's working. the concern is it's not working as well as all of us up here would like it to work. what can we do and the administration do to get this back on track again. >> yes. >> yeah. >> thank you for your question and your thoughts, mr. chairman. i fully share your concerns about this crisis of foreclosures and defaults and mortgages across the country.millions of americans have been affected by this. there are many desperate households today anxious to hold on to their@@@@@@@@)@ @ h )r, take time to really reach full scale, and as you said, it is important that the congress and the public perform these programs. i would pledge to you that if i am confirmed, one of my first acts will be to reexamine our ie   reporting. re-examine our information systems and our reporting. and i know that the treasury has pulled together more information as we speak about this program. i think we have to be agile as we look at this program as well. let's see how it's working. if it's not working as effectively as it needs to, we'll make every effort to make it more efficient and more effective and to reach more people. what's extremely important in dealing with the mortgage crisis is to reach out to as manypeople as possible. people are fearful about losing their hopes. they're fearful of contacting their bank or their servicer to describe their problem, for fear that that could cause itself a foreclosure on their house. we have to reach out and tell people programs are available. banks are willing to work with you. fannie mae and freddie mac are willing to work with you. you can go to the financialstability.gov website if you're a homeowner who's concerned and get more information and contacts, people   who can counsel homeowners about how best to hold on to their homes. >> but the servicers need to do this as well. we carved out the safe harbor for these, which was controversial, to insulate them against lawsuits from investors. and we -- frankly the investor community broke up and said you're breaking contracts here. and they're right. but we understood if we didn't do that, the argument would be, look, we'd like to help out these homeowners but we can't face the possibility of an overwhelming number of lawsuits for investors that will sue usfor engaging in modifications. so, we insulated them from the problems. what are the servicers doing? servicer by servicer, what are they doing out there? the homeowner is reluctant, you're right. the servicer shouldn't be reluctant in light of the safe hashers. we want to know what they're doing and whether or not we are probing the servicers if they are not, in fact, stepping up if, in fact, they are not doing that. >> mr. chairman, thank you for your question. at least 14 of the top servicers in the country have already   signed up and already active in this program and they account, including fannie mae and freddie mac, for over three-fourths of mortgages in america. so, this is moving ahead. i will say that this is an extremely complex, large-scale program. it will take time to get to speed. it's moving ahead rapidly. i think in the next few months we'll see it reaching out to more people. it's encouraging that offer mortgage modification offers have been sent out to people. we've received millions of contacts on the website.people wanting more information. so, again, this is a matter of outreach. it's a matter of taking some time so that these banks can reconfigure some of their systems and their capability to be able to handle the large volumes that we expect, but it is moving forward and i'll be happy to report to you often on the progress of that program. >> i appreciate it. senator warner wanted to make a comment on that. >> thank you, mr. chairman, and thank you for opening up this line of questioning. mr. allison, good to see you this morning. and i'm glad you raised the   issue of 100,000, that's what aye heard as well. i know folks in my state know when he was here. and a great deal of collaboration with hud. we told folks to call after march 4th and people in my state would call and they would then get a basic response that said, well, thanks, but we don't have any of the details ready. and i understand the complexity. i think the chairman's raised a good point about perhaps anombudsman so that some kind of appeals or process so that if you can't get answers, a website alone may not be enough. i guess one of the things i think would be helpful from an information stand point, and this just may be one-off examples. but what i'm hearing in my state is that there are a number of banks that basically have stopped processing foreclosures, waiting for this loan modification program to be fully in place. and that while the wave of   foreclosure has slowed, it's not slowed because necessarily economic conditions have dramatically improved but everybody's just kind of taking a time-out while the loan modification program is put in great. it's great that 100,000 offers have been made, one, i'd like to know how many of those offers have been accepted. and, two, if all of these servicers don't get fully engaged, do we have this enormous, potentially multimillion backlog of foreclosures waiting to floodthe system if these initiatives are not successful? do you have any sense on whether there's this backlog that's been created? is this just kind of a one-off example or -- my sense is it's probably going on around the country. >> yes, sir. thank you, senator, for your question and for your concerns about this. it certainly is true that the program had to be organized and during the organization period anxious homeowners were calling in trying to find out when they could get assistance. i think we see a much fully   response today than just a couple of months ago. as to the foreclosure crisis, there were moratoriums, many of those have been lifted now. but recently the government has instituted a couple of new programs that can ease this situation for homeowners. one is called deed in lieu, and also there are efforts to get out to as many people right now as possible to engage in mortgage modifications. and i think it's extremelyimportant -- i'll say this again, that we all reach out to as many people as possible to alert them to these programs, that help is available for them. and -- and i think as we do that, we can help prevent many, many foreclosures. one of the prime objectives of this administration is to do all possible to keep people in their homes, and we need feedback. we need information systems. if i'm confirmed, i will come back to you and other members of the committee with fulsome   reporting about the progress of carrying out mortgage modifications, the pace at which we're doing it, whether we're on track and what more we can do going forward. >> thank you, sir. that will obviously include what percentage of the take-up of that 100,000 offers 45i s made, kind of backlog we're looking at. i'm just concerned we may have in a sense a false sense of progress because there are people in arrears, people about to be foreclosed upon. the actions haven't been taken. but, my gosh, if these -- if thebullets we've fired we haven't worked, we got to be prepared for what's next. >> i full hill share your concern about that, senator, and we will provide you with that information. thank you. >> senator schumer wanted to make a comment on this as well, too. >> i just had a quick question, and i apologize for having to go. i'm just curious, how much of the program capital funds do you anticipate to be paid next week, next six months, next year? how much are we going to get back, which gives you money to play with, i guess, but not play   with, but have a need or an emergency. >> senator, i will have to await the final results on that. that will be communicated as soon as possible. as the treasury has been communicating repayments over time. >> don't we expect a bump next week? >> i think that's quite likely that there will be a bump next week. >> do you have any idea a ballpark estimate? >> i wouldn't want to make an estimate, senator, as to what it will be. i will wait for the federalreserve and the treasury to complete that process. >> okay. and just one more quickie. >> yes, sir. >> several firms feel that they're going to be at a disadvantage if their competitors are approved for repayment before they are. there's always competition, of course. >> yes, yes. >> have you heard that concern? how are you going to address it? >> senator, i have heard that concern. and i'm sure that the administration is well aware of that. and it will be taken into account as the announcements are made. >> senator shelby? >> thank you, mr. chairman.   mr. allison, thank you for taking on this responsibility. i wish you well. what assurances have you been given from secretary geithner and the white house that you will have sufficient ought tautn your decision making for this program? >> senator, first of all, i understand my responsibilities. if i'm confirmed for this position.and my role is to carry out the treasury secretary's directives as well on this program. he and i will be consulting frequently. i know how concerned he is about making sure that these programs are successful. i see him daily about these issues. and those contacts will probay grow even closer if i am confirmed. >> what's your view, if you have one, at the moment of how the treasury, which you'll be right   in the central role there, should manage its investments in gm and chrysler? and how long do you believe treasury will be a shareholder of gm and chrysler, if you want to? >> thank you for the question, senator. >> i must say to you that i have not been involved directly in the auto initiatives. and at this point that would have been presumer erpresumtuouconfirmed. >> but you plan to get involved. with both elbows. >> absolutely. i assure you i'll get involved in all the initiatives under the financial stability program. >> well, your number one goal here is to get confirmed. we all here under that. aig, the management of aig, what steps do you believe need to be taken, have you thought about this, for the federal government's oversight of aig? in other words, you got a big   bear and you can't turn it loose. it's -- i hope we won't have to put more money into it. i don't know. but it's -- it's -- seems -- i don't know how you discard it. >> senator, certainly i understand the importance of the aig situation. again, i have to tell you that aye n i've not been involved in aig, because, again, that would have been presummous if i had gotteninvolved in that. i'll turn to that issue as well and i'll be happy to come back and discuss it with you. >> just a generic thing. how do you believe -- what do you believe is the best way for the federal government to manage its equity investments in the t.a.r.p. recipients to, one, ensure that the management of these firms have the proper incentives in running these companies and hopefully paying back the money? youould have an interest in   that, would you not? >> yes, sir. i think that's a very important question that you're asking, and very shortly the administration will be announcing its policies as a shareholder in the companies. and we have all heard the president as well as secretary geithner say the government has no desire to be a day-to-day manager of those companies. it will be a shareholder. and its policies on governance as a shareholder will be made public soon. >> mr. allison, you well knowthis, we all do, government programs are quite often difficult to create and sometimes just about impossible to terminate. the t.a.r.p. has a statutory termination date that can be slightly extended. >> yes, sir. >> at the request of the treasury secretary. you know this. do you believe that the t.a.r.p. program should ultimately be terminated? and would you have any concerns if the program were converted into some kind of permanent   revolving fund? >> senator, i think that's an important question, many americans as well as people in congress are asking. as you said, the program is scheduled to terminate at the end of the year, although it could be extended by an act of the secretary until, i believe, as late as october of 2010. but i think it's important to point out that the programs within the financial stability area have themselves terminationprovisions, many of them. there are terms to the financing, end dates. there are also disincentives built into those programs that cause, should cause, banks to want to repay that money as fast as possible. we've already seen, and we will see, additional repayments. so, this program is designed to deal with extremely serious financial crisis. and it was not set up to be a long-term, permanent program. >> mr. allison, while the   t.a.r.p. program has provided hundreds of billions of dollars to the banking sector, there have been a lot of complaints, and we all hear it here in the senate, that the banks receiving t.a.r.p. funds are not making loans, at least not enough. what is being done, what do you intend to do, about ensuring that the t.a.r.p. recipients are making loans particularly to small businesses? we're not talking about making bad loans. i know you can't micromanage thedaily activities of them. but as far as policy, it seems that small business community's really being squeezed in the financial sector in this country. >> yes, sir. well, we're acutely aware that in many small communities around the country, small businesses are still having difficulty getting access to credit. i think there are a number of reasons for that, but it's important to point out that the secretary recently directed that we would reopen the capital   purchase program for small banks, which provide an outsize portion of lending to small businesses around the country. >> you believe that will help a lot, don't you? >> i do. i think it's important. we're not forcing money on banks. we're making money available. and we are -- want to be helpful in every possible way to small business. where also the secretary has initiated a number of actions, and to small banks. i think what the first p","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN : June 5, 2009 3:00pm-3:30pm

>> again, the whole -- again, there are bad guys out there. some are just twirls -- trolls. these are just people who disapprove of stuff. there are people who work on the site to draw that to your attention, and you have to buildmechanisms which removed automatically or manually. in advertisements, it is mostly automatic. in our discussion boards, is largely manual, and i have the pleasure of removing a lot of that as recently as maybe 20 or 30 minutes ago. you are going to see a lot of ugly stuff. you will see people bickering sometimes regarding animals and pets. you will see it as predictable in politics. you will see spam, too, some   of the of a rather unpleasant nature. there, and list the help of your community, but count on a lot of personal engagement for a long time. i do suspect we have a better mix of anonymity and identity on the net, that will be easier to deal with, but i am committed to this stuff but only as long as i live. >> i want to probe on that, because there is a strain ofthinking in this community that highly prizes anonymity, and i think on craigslist, you have come to the conclusion that sometimes, identifying people helps the community to be better, and you have talked about how sometimes you want to do that. talk about where people should be identified, where should blogs be kept, so, i assume, you can point the finger at people to be a badly -- where should logs be kept.   >> this speaks to my dual role in my eighth day job, -- in my day job. the privacy and bill of rights issues. dating back -- i think i've found a bug in the phone, but this goes back to a civics class, where he introduced this thing called the bill of rights,and the deal there is that one thing we need a very practical sense is anonymity for people like whistle-blowers, stuff like that. and you need to have people being accountable. some of the very angry bickering, i want to be able to   tell them, ""hey, cut this out, to speak so that balance has to be addressed. i think we will see it sooner than we expect -- ""hey, cut that out,"" so that balance has to be addressed. the accountability they are going to want. the decisions will be tough at times, because lack of accountability means more work for us and for me specifically,but, you know, the idea of anonymity and privacy rights is an emotional issue for people like me. i do not have any answers now. i would just see how things go, personally speaking, -- i will just see how things go. when it comes to the company, i will provide feedback. >> it sounds like you are leading towards a rule where people need to identify themselves.   >> i do not think i am moving that way, but the deal is that we are driven by our community. we listened to the community in a big way, and it happen from day one, literally, in 1995, and we are driven by what people tell us. we will pose questions to people asking us to address the mix, and we will change in response to that. sometimes, boy, sometimes we hear people tell us we need to reconsider decisions.yesterday, i heard a very reasonable argument from a guy in alaska suggesting we should find some ways to allow for a gun at advertisements in alaska. -- for gun advertisements in alaska. in 1998, we had a ruling that there be no gun advertisements based on a lot of community feedback, and we have stuck with that. now, we are hearing from this by arguments otherwise.   i do not know if we can do anything about it for a while, because we are swamped, but we do listen to people, and then we try to do something about that. >> you are not a direct democracy. it is not like you put it to a vote, the guns or no guns, but is there anything more other than listening to the email that comes in? >> it is kind of let you areexplaining. anecdotal, we listen to feedback, and then we try to make the best decision began. oftentimes, it is explicit feedback regarding categories. for example, that is why we have a bigger city -- a babysitting category, helping parents to get a baby sitter.   that is craigslist. for me, and going back and forth between mostly talking just for myself, occasionally referring to our history, you know, it in the company, but i thought a lot about governance, four countries, foresights like ours and wikipedia, for anything. sometimes, to make decisions or recommendations or anything, you need a balance between commandand control, top-down systems -- for sites, for countries. on the other hand, if you believe in democracy, we believe in people working together and decide together what is going to happen from the bottom-up. again, that is true when it comes to news or being a movie critic or whatever.   sometimes, you are an expert to place some kind of a role, and sometimes, you want the crowd to decide, but i do think you need some kind of balance. i think wikipedia does a very good job, but this whole thing is in motion because the technology is still moving. >> are we going to be happy if we want to open government with that methodology? the political leaders listen through anecdotal or other meansand then decide? is that open enough? >> i think we can do much better with open government, and that started with the initiative going back a week or so. the deal is to find out what people are really saying. what people really want. the idea is that the discussion board mechanisms allow a few people may be sometimes extreme views that dominate the conversation with the ability to vote up and down stuff, millions   of people are for dissipating, then, that is what can really make war. because right now, even the congressmen, they get emails sometimes an organized campaigns, and, you know, if they are getting back, they tend, and they have told me, they are not going to be listening to that. what they what is emails for actual constituents. they want the real stuff, be real feedback, and the mechanisms to make that happen are happening now, i think --the real feedback. i am now beginning to seek participation in these efforts, on this -- in these efforts. on this participation is part of this. >> with craigslist.com you have got the community that have been doing what they have been doing in the various adult services and erotic services, and any   others that think that that should not be going on, attorney generals, and center, and then there is the interaction between the community -- etc., and then there is the interaction. >> well, sometimes fighting the good fight it's awkward and delicate, and the deal is that, well, like conan the barbarian said, what does not kill you makes you strong -- fighting thegood fight is awkward. the community has been overwhelming in its support for us. this has been pretty gratifying. people have been telling us we are doing the right thing, and people have been pretty patient with us, which i appreciate. the only downside with me personally has been an increase in fan mail. i feel obliged to answer everything, and that means extra   work in some senses. i mean, my email address is really craig@craigslist.com. email in the afternoon pacific coast time, otherwise, it will get lost. seriously, that is my email. i answer everything, unless the person is, let's say, being inan unfavorable manner, and i have to pick up the customer service request to my boss. remember, i act as a customer service rep, not manager as customer service. sometimes, we have the opportunity to do the right thing, and we will do it. but we are always listening to our community as to what the right feedback is, as to what the feedback directs us to. >> do you see it, changing the   name ""erotic services"" to ""adult services,"" and charging a fee? >> that is what the community wants. i do not think i can speak for them. >> picking fights with the attorney-general -- with theattorney generals, hal do you see craigslist in society, and why is it -- how do you see craigslist in society, and how is it that you want to be filing suits like that? >> we do respond inappropriate ways. >> and that is appropriate because? >> because it was the right way to do so in our current environment.   >> what do you think will come of that? >> i do not know. [laughter] >> do you think the community -- people find themselves in the full range of human wants and needs and operas that areexchanged, is that going to thrive in this environment, or are there going to be places where one step after another, pieces of that are going to be split off -- the range of human wants and needs and other that are exchanged. >> i do not see how that is a problem. >> in the future? >> craigslist in 10 years will   be about the same. we are passionate about the mundane and the boring. specifically, if you want to give people a break, help them find a job for a place to live, the kind of stuff, you know, that is the focus right there be a you know, we've lived in the real world, where, again, you want to give a person a break, you got them find a job or a place to live, keep that part free. the difference is we will be inmore cities. we will be in more countries. we will be in more languages. frankly, we probably need to be in more language's right now. >> how do you see that perpetuating? because one thing you have in the way that you run craigslist as the way you just described is an ethic that you make just enough money. you do not make too much money -- we probably need to be in more languages right now.   it is a for-profit company. you have ebay as a shareholder. you are not going to live forever, i am sorry to say. is there a way of creating the organization that is permanently devoted to the values and the operating procedures you're talking about? at some point, does it become owned by shareholders and people who want to make as much money as they feel like? >> we have taken a lot of measures to preserve the value of the site.i do joke about nerd values, which says that once you provide for your future, it is more satisfying to change the world. the ceo does a great job of that. if you look down, you will see i   am standing on a box, but there is a value system. i am committed to this for my life. we have a 6 spam 8 hours extra day. i may commit to my own version of public service -- we have 6 to 8 hours extra per day.speak directly into the mic. >> let's talk about the newspaper business. no small number of newspaper executives think that the classified advertising revenue, the decline, which craigslist had something to do with it, is   a contributor to their financial situation. >> i spoke with a lot of newspaper executives, and none of them blame us. they point to newspapers having a lot of problems which are causing issues. for example, the loss of circulation. and they tell me, even the pure research people say it has to have something to do with the loss of trust -- even the pewpeople say that. i think the issue will be trust, and the way you get that is with a lot of fact checking. you get that with maintaining clear distinctions between the editorial and reporting side of the business and the advertising and funding side of the business. the news organizations that do those kind of things, they will be the ones who are perceived as trustworthy.   and those are the ones that people will pay extra for, and other news organizations may have to fight for a dwindling pool of ad dollars, so, again, i think trustworthiness, fact checking. you know, trust is the new black, and not just for news organizations. >> i want to ask another question, and then we will flippant up to the audience, and people can line up at themicrophone if you have questions for craig. with the news, you have been involved in new media projects. tell me a little about what you have been trying to do with this activism and refunding in terms of spawning various forms of media. >> well, when it comes to the business, at best, i am a dilettante. what i am trying to do is talk to the folks who are providing the tools and mechanisms to do increasingly good reporting,   particularly investigative reporting, fact checking, and all of that. i abort with i abortnyu. -- i have been working with working with-- i have been working with someone at nyu, where they are working with the huffington post. there are investigative reporters that can look into what is going on in governmentand see what is happening. i have talked and worked with some folks at the aspen institute and the berkeley journalism school on the theme of what are the business models that will help journalism survive. but me, i am an outsider. i am discussing this in kind of a casual way, and focused way, because i used to be an engineer, trying to talk about how we make the news business   drive, because we need, you know, -- how we make the news business thrive so we can prevent problems, like governments going off on major misadventures, or allowing major financial crises to occur. asking tough questions with other people in the news, backing up people like helen toget the job done. again, i am a dilettante in this, but like all the good government actions going on right now, i realize that, you know, i am the far end of the internet. i know enough to see when something good is going on, and then i will stand up for those activities, and then, i will do more. today, the fda announced the new transparency initiative. not bad. i will tell people about it. i do not think i am being a   journalist when i do that kind of thing. i am just trying to be a stand a guy with all of my fault. >> a tough question. identify yourself. >> what moral and ethical responsibilities should there be for an advertiser on craigslist? i did get a job from your list that i did work for in january,february, and march that i still have not gotten paid for. do you have a suggestion for me to try to get my current pay? and one result from the situation is that i have had an extended but not always welcome email correspondence with ted leonsis and another used to be at aol. >> well, there are a bunch of questions in that one, but the deal is if we hear about   someone performing in a bad way on the side, we, you know, what i have done, when i can, and it in a bad way on the site -- when we hear about someone performing in a bad way on the site, we, you know, what i have done, when i can, send us the link. >> hello, i just wanted to speakup on one of the questions you asked craig about him being involved singlehandedly in the demise of all the newspapers, and there is our seven organizations used in the internet technologies are not killing these things. they are just providing an avenue for people who would not have paid for that material in the first place, people who would not buy nikola   advertisements, they will do it now on craigslist because it is free. >> i just do not dig the relationship, what is going on with the ria and all of that stuff, and i have a feeling instead of trying to respond in a way that will lead to their survival and profits, they are kind of, well, i guess thephrase is self-inflicted wounds. i do not get it as a nerd, but as a nerd, there are many things i do not get. >> i am wondering if he actually believes that craigslist has had anything to do with that. i believe that the internet destroys profits, and i believe that craigslist is the epitome of taking money from something   that used to cost money and vaporizing that advantage and those profits, so i think that there is money that was made by ""the boston globe,"" ""the l.a. times,"" and others which will not be made. current economic models are not going to pay for it, nothing personal, but i do believe that craigslist and the trend thatrepresents our part of the destruction of a particular kind of business that existed in a particular kind of technological environment. >> . shame on you then, craig. >> i think it is indisputably true that there are a lot of people used to play for advertisements.   i am one of them. i am a small landlord. that is how i can continue to work as a public-interest law year despite the fact that our salaries are abysmal, and one of the ways i am able to make a little more money is that instead of having to pay for advertisements when i have someone move out of one of our apartment, we advertise them on craigslist.com and there are people in the community always look on craigslist for the best new places that have become an open, and we benefit from that.this is not to suggest that the loss of revenue from the and people like me has not hurt the newspaper industry. >> on the notion of ideas scale and other discussion boards, how do you go about making sure that everyone can participate in this? we talked about how important it was not to let trolls crowd out others, and there are access problems, including multi and   lingual issues. what is your way of solving that? >> you are right. we want everyone to participate in this kind of open government discussion, and right now, it is focused on the web, which, you know, may or may not be fair, especially when you consider is just starting. that is, we need to open this up to everyone possible. i think a key to that is finding ways to use telephones in this,because not everyone has a cell phone, but it looks like cell phones, especially as they get smarter and interconnected, cell phones i think will be the key to access for everyone, and not just in the u.s.. i see it already here between the young and old, in digital divide, because right now, -- a digital divide, because younger age ranges are a lot more   comfortable with electronic media, and that is a small but growing problem. it is personally distressing. well, let's say i have been an aarp member for years, and the kids with their loud rock-and- roll and instant messaging, i just cannot keep up, but this is, kids, get off of my ĂŠlan. >> sir, i am an attorney in town. first, i want to congratulateyou on your amazing accomplishment and no matter how you slice it, craigslist is incredibly influential and incredibly powerful, so thank you. with that kind of kissing up kind of preface, the adult services/erotic services. saul press you on that, and your response is, in effect, that is what members want us to do. there is an enormous component.   do not look to me. that is what members chose, and that is all well and good except, i take it, craigslist is not a democracy and does exercise discretion of when the community voice in government and when it does not, and i wonder what you would say about the tensions. how much should people look to craigslist as a normative actor versus looking at the community as a normative actor? >> i will confess my ignoranceof the everyday use of the term ""normative,"" but the deal is we listened to the community. we try to do the right thing legally. we balance them, and you see the results. >> hey, craig. andrew witha do a dot com. the cell phone, the smart   phone, this is going to be the way that people access craigslist or get information from other places of information. there are so limited, and there is only so much you can do in the palm of your hands, and i can do school assignments, but if i just have a cell phone or a smart phone, and that is all i have,","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN : June 5, 2009 4:30pm-5:00pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

now we're asking for $50 million. can you tell us how those funds are used and why they are so important to what you're doing? >> yes, sir. the 1208 authority is peculiar to special operations. it requires that the funds be used to support ongoing special operations. this is really enabling the special operations forces to extend their operations through the use of surrogates and counterparts to conduct   activities in partnership or in support of the special operations forces who are on that operation. it is an authority, not an appropriation. it authorizes united states special operations command to recommend. to the secretary -- secretary of defense after coordinating with the geographic combatant commander and chief of commission in the country, to utilize up to currently $35 million of o&m funds fromwithin the special operations budget, so it is an issue of prioritization within our budget. it's enormously important because it is an agile fund, it's a focused fund. it's used for purposes that are well coordinated and in a closed session i could provide a fair bit of detail about how it has had effect around the   world. >> certainly i think it's a program that we strongly support, and i think it essentially contributes to the second area of questioning. that is the importance of the interagency cooperation in what you're doing, which is increasingly important. when we look at this broadly, globally, as a counterinsurgency fight. there are a lot of different pieces that are going to have to be pulled together in order to make this work. i think i have seen special operations command under your leadership and also out in thefield under the leadership of at one point general mcchrystal. i think pulled those pieces together about as effectively as anywhere i have seen in government. as we go forward and you look outside of areas like iraq and afghanistan where i think we're specifically familiar with the struggles there. you look to some of these emerging threat environments around the horn of africa and yemen and a.q. what do you think is most important toward the pushing forward of that level of cooperation between other   elements of d.o.d., state, and the intel community? >> the most important thing to push forward are structures that provide a forum so that the community can provide the content to the discussions. these are relationships that are building over time. we are pay better than we have ever been. we're not as good as we will be next year or the year after,but so much of it has to do with just understanding each other's organizations and cultures and we're even seeing now what i call second or third generation, second or third order effects of people who work together in one place coming together in another place and already having a relationship so that they can move much more quickly together. joe mcchrystal set the standard aggressively at the operational level. the united states special operations command is serving   as a model of sorts at the higher headquarters level. we wake up every day with about 85 uniformed members of the special operations command going to work in other agencies of government inside the national capital region. most of the agencies that you would expect and perhaps some that you wouldn't normally expect us to be in in small teams, typically two to four people with an 06 colonel or a navy captain as the team leader. we also wake up every day at our headquarters at macdill air force base in tampa with about140 members of other agencies coming to work in our headquarters. important members of the team sitting in on all the discussions, thinking in on all the global collaboration kinds of briefings, and this has provided a transparency in the interagency environment that's very helpful. and i -- it's hard now having seen it in action for a few years to imagine to remember back what it was like before we   looked -- back when we used to look around a room and see only uniformed members. it real is a good, solid team effort at this point. >> this is something i want to encourage. getting people from the different agencies to actually work together side by side, day in and day out with each other in different forms. you have done an excellent job as you mentioned of sprinkling people out in other places, other agencies need to do that as well. i think the ntc is a good forumfor that. we want to see that happen more and more and look for ways to encourage that. in particular, some of the title 10, title 50 conflicts between intel and d.o.d. can be resolved better if we start having more sharing back and forth. now, obviously we understand all of those different pieces have personnel to manage. that's a great challenge i know for you and your personnel sent all over a bunch of other places, you have a core mission to accomplish. along the way if there are ways that we can help you free up   more personnel, please let us know. i know we have an ongoing issue just in terms of the management within your own entity of different service members, and we are communicating that concern to d.o.d. in trying to give you the authority you need to better manage your own personnel. certainly we look for those opportunities also to build those relationships and really just sort of continue on with the goldwater-nichols principle, now aplay the cross agency lines as well as d.o.d.we look forward to do that. with that, i yield to mr. miller. >> thank you, mr. chairman. i serve on the nato parliament assembly. i have had an opportunity to visit with some of our nato allies. they are indeed proud of the contributions that they are making certainly within the community. certainly within afghanistan. what i would like to ask you for the record, if you would, explain the impact of the soft capabilities of those partners in the current fight as it   exists in afghanistan, and if you could update as well on iraq as we transition out. >> yes, sir. from your visits to the nato soft coordination center, you understand how this team is coming together and there is bonding that is occurring across the special operations forces of nato at the headquarters environment. i think it's inspired, certainly stimulated the activities of some special operations forces beingprovided to the isaf effort in afghanistan. so i'm not the expert on how individual nations special operations forces are performing, what their activities are in afghanistan. that's outside my realm of responsibility. i'm not sure my monitorship is strong enough to give a coherent and accurate answer on that at this point. i will say that in my discussions with nato's soft   leaders, there is a sense of community that is forming within the special -- across the nation's special operations communities. i would term it loosely, perhaps operations forces, special operations flag is something around which nato forces can rally. it's a relatively inexpensive, relatively low level investment in a much broader military capability that nato canprovide. the nato soft coordination center now, as you know, is less than three years old, but it has got its legs up under it pretty well. >> what can we do -- what do you think we can do to assist our allies as they develop their soft units? >> sir, i think there is already robust activity in   nato, and we're seeing some nato countries step forward in terms of presenting their special operations forces as subject matter experts in particular disciplines and then serving -- using that to attract others to exercise and train with them. so there is a synergy that's occurring bilaterally in areas where the united states isn't involved and multilaterally and bilaterally where we are. i think that my shortest answer to that would be to explore ways to operationalize the natosoft coordination center, and i'm not knowledgeable enough about how nato works organizationally to understand the details and nuances of that. the nato soft coordination center director is now a dual hatted american two-star general who serves in his primary role as the commander of special operations command european command. so i would suggest exploring   ways by which we might form a separate director for the nato soft coordination center. >> one question moving away from nato involves where we are with our gunships. certainly with asoc in my district, it appears that there is a shortfall. but the budget doesn't request any additional funding forgunships this year. can you talk about our plans or your plans to address that particular shortfall along with your plans to maintain, modernize, and upgrade the existing aircraft that are out there? >> yes, sir. we have a recapitalization program for most of the rest of our c-130 fleet, 37 -hcmc-130-j's will come into our program.   that was a higher priority initially than the ac-130 gunship for recapitalization because of the ages of the air frames involved. the recent level of activity in afghanistan is causing us to understand again how important our precision firepower is in that tactile environment, and we have -- we are understanding clearly that our capacity isinsufficient and that other platforms, substitute platforms simply don't bring the same response to troops in contact that an ac-130 does. ac-130 is not a precision fire platform. it's actually an area fire weapon that's extremely accurate with its sensors and guns. so what we are doing to augment the ac-130 fleet, what we are seeking to do immediately is   modify our mc-130-w fleet to serve as a platform for a standoff precision-guided munition as a primary weapon and a 30-millimeter gun as a secondary weapon. all proven systems. it's simple a matter of integrating them in a platform that hasn't been used for that purpose before. we are seeking funds to do this . we think that because thetechnology risk is so low that we can deliver it very quickly. >> thank you. that's all for now. >> thank you. >> mr. mcintyre is recognized for five minutes. >> thank you. thank you for being with us, admiral. thank you again for your hospitality. last year when i was able to join you down in tampa. thank you for the service you give to us here at home and around the world. the concern about wear and tear on equipment i know is one that we have had especially since   the situation occurred in iraq. tell me with regard specifically to the special operations forces equipment and resources, what resources are you finding under your command that are experiencing the greatest wear and tear and to what exactly do you attribute this extraordinary aging process, and do you have some thoughts you could share with us about how we can might best help you address that situation? >> yes, sir. i don't think it will surprise anybody. the answer is that it's ourmobility systems that are suffering the most wear and tear because of the ways that they are used and the pace that they are used. so i asked my staff just recently to give me the top five items in terms of what we're seeing wear and tear. it's exactly what you would think. it's our fixed wing and rotary wing aviation. it's our ground mobility fleet. in one case, it's a maritime platform. we're simply flying more hours. we're driving more miles.   we're spending more time on the water. and this is just at a pace beyond what we had predicted when those systems were procured. so we are refurbishing them more often, and we have been resourced adequately to do that . my person looking ahead is simply that we sustain the level of resources that will permit us to keep this equipment going as we lookforward to some forces perhaps drawing down in iraq especially. we don't see that happening with special operations forces at all. so as we have come to depend on some special funding means to keep this equipment going and the operational environment, we're going to have to find a way to work that into our base line budget in order to sustain this equipment over time. >> on that point, as we were drawing down our conventional forces, i know there were some challenges in terms of you   staying there in the same numbers and mitigating sure you continue to get the support equipment you get. a lot of that you get from the conventional forces in the field. how is that playing out? are you satisfied those concerns are being met or is there more that need to be done? >> i think it's playing out well. recently, we have had service chief level talks with the commandant of the marine corps and the chief of staff of the army. we are in complete accord about what the challenges are and seeking ways together to resolve those. i think there is a broad understanding that whether it'sa small force in an area or a large force in an area, you still need somebody to control the airspace, operate the airfields o'provide the quick reaction for us, provide the medical support, do all the rest of it that it takes to look after the force that is forward. and so we are helping them help us by doing the detailed analysis of exactly what it is we think will have to be left behind, if you will, by the forces that draw down in order   to sustain the activity that stays behind. so i think we're on a good track with that in our conversations with the services. >> all right, thanks. i apologize. >> thank you tell us what the typical rotational cycles are of soft personnel particularly in centcom and how that may be affecting what you feel you can best do with regard to keeping up with the pace in terms of the rotation of personnel? i know that's come up in thebroader context of our military. i specifically am concerned with how that's affecting you in special operations forces. >> yes, sir. the service components have sort of evolved into different rotational paces depending on the type of equipment they use, the nature of the operations they are conducting. it ranges from about 90 days on the short end for some of our aviators who fly an awful lot of hours at night on night-vision goggles and who   burn up their allotted flying hours more quickly and therefore need to come back and sort of reset. through about seven months for our special forces operational detachment a teams, the green berets who are at battalion level rotations at that pace. then it extends beyond that to one-year rotations for many at the headquarters to provide a campaign continuity at the effort of the more seniorlevels. the right now is sustainable. our predictions about how long we could sustain it are wrong. we didn't think we could sustain it at this pace for long. but the force is proving resilient beyond our estimates. i think personally that we are at about the fax rate that we can sustain, but i think we can sustain this rate for some time   longer. it has now become the new normal. it is the way we operate. people who have been doing this have been doing it long enough to know this is what they can expect to do. our retention rate remains high and our recruiting remains healthy. so if the demand didn't increase, we're probably pretty ok, but what we're seeing is anincreasing demand for special operations forces, so we have a growth plan in place to accommodate that. >> thank you. good to have you here. thank you, mr. chairman. >> thank you. >> thank you, mr. chairman. i apologize for being late. i had some hoosiers in the office that didn't want to let me go. if this question has been discussed, just let me go and i will move on to something else. could you talk, admiral, a little bit about the interoperability between the   agencies. if things are being done in the most efficient manner between the interagency cooperation, some of the challenges you might have faced, what's the best practice and what are our successes and what challenges are you facing in the meld there? >> we did address that at some level, and what i said very quickly was it's better than it has ever been. it will get better. we are now at the point where the structures have evolved to provide the venues for these kinds of interactions to occur.now it's a matter of the people getting the knowledge of each other's organizations and traditions and frankly languages in order to talk to the efficiency of it. the trend is certainly one in the right direction. we are way ahead of where we thought we might be a couple of years ago. >> this is totally unrelated. but an area of particular interest for me. discuss what you can about our attempts and our movement to   the nonlethal field. where we're at on that. whether vehicle stops or personnel stops -- i know that's not normally what would be discussed in special ops, but certainly it would be a valuable part in winning hearts and minds. if you wouldn't mind telling me where we're at and what we need. >> we are all in favor of every applicable nonlethal technology. we understand as well as anybody, i think, that killing people is not the way to success in either iraq, afghanistan, or anywhere elsethat we work and that a nonlethal effect that can then give you time to sort out the situation, sort out the people would be a great advantage on the battlefield. special operations is in favor of any feasible appropriate technology. our position, though, is that those followings have a much broader application than special operations forces. we are advocates of it, we are champions for it, we are   supporters and cheerleaders for it. but we have very few of those programs initiated within the special operations budget itself. >> i am embarrassed being in congress and armed services. i'm watching the discovery channel and seeing some of the new following about the heat projecting apparatus. i don't even know what to call it. very interesting. is that on the edge of being used?>> my staff is telling me it's called the active denial system. >> that's a great name for that. couldn't have named it better myself. is that in the prototype stage? is it being used in those kind of things? >> i saw that demonstrated but it's been a couple of years ago. i don't know what has happened actually since then. >> mr. chairman, i yield back. >> a couple more areas i wanted to ask about. then we'll go back to the members as well. piracy has been emerging as a   threat and a challenge. i guess congratulations is the word on running a very, very good operation in rescuing the mersk crew. about a month or so ago, we had an opportunity to get briefed by captain moore and a couple of others who had participated in that operation. very impressive accomplish many. it's great. all those years ago, it's what you were trained to do. basically we're set up so if there was a hostage situation anywhere in the world, you would respond very, very quickly. you have been doing a lot of other things in between, but itwas very impressive to see that that training paid off and we knew what to do. going forward in terms of how we confront piracy, certainly it's a challenge in that part of the world off the coast of somalia and it has huge implications that we need to try to confront. tame as we have mentioned in this hearing, you have a wealth of other responsibilities that are also important in afghanistan and pakistan, a variety of other places. one of my concerns is that with the media attention on piracy coming up, if we shift too much   of our focus in that direction, we distract from the other very important missions as well. just wanted to know if you could comment on how you see their role in combating piracy in that part of the world and any concerns you may have about how it may distract from some of the other missions? >> we have -- obviously, across the military, there is robust capability to take on piracy in different ways. special operations contributes some of the capability to thatas was evidenced here a couple of months ago. how that force is used is a matter of policy. it's my responsibility to train the force to do what it is it is asked to do. we do keep some elements of our force on standby, on alert to respond to that kind of situation so that if they are infrequent, then i think we would consider it not to be much of a -- much of a burden on the course. >> even with everything that's going on the last eight years,   that has always been the case that you have had that standby for us. >> yes, sir. >> i didn't mean to interrupt. >> again, it's more of a policy issue. the question is really are we going to prevent piracy or are we going to respond to piracy with the military force? today we have been more in the business of -- with my force, of responding to those -- ofproviding those who respond to it and we're able to continue that mission without impacting on our others. >> certainly. mr. miller. >> i will pass. >> i have got more questions. mr. mcintyre, do you have anything you wanted to add? >> i just want to ask you if you feel like that the partnership with nato and their special operations capability is working well. >> we did address that briefly   earlier, but the nato special operations coordination center, the nscc headquarters is an up and running organization. it's not fully manned. it's not fully capable yet. but the relationships that have occurred within that organization have developed quite strong bonds among the nato special operations forces. i was able to attend their first annual conference last year. 28 countries, i believe, came to that conference.it was remarkable how similar the conversations were, the vision is across the special operations forces of nato. some of which say they feel that they have more in common with the special operations forces of other nations than they do with other forces of their own nation because of the way that they train and exercise. together. i think there is an opportunity to take that to the next step. i'm just not certain what the next step is and what i mentioned before is that we might explore a way to talk, to   operationalize the nato soft coordination center in some way and provided an independent director who is now a dual-hatted officer. >> thank you. >> following up on that, a trip i took in january with some members on the way back from iraq. we visited the special operations forces, nato command. i just can't tell you how impressed we were by the degree of coordination. without getting into too manydetailed aspersions here, we did not find similar coordination in other parts of nato that we had met with. that's a major, major challenge in afghanistan, figuring out how to get all of our partner nations. it would be far too ambitious to say on the same page or at least in the same book when it comes to how we're going to confront afghanistan and pakistan. nato is set up the way it's set up. it's an important alliance. it's very difficult to manage that many different countries coming from that many different   perspectives. i certainly have a fair amount of respect for the difficulty that the organizations faces. we went to all these meetings on that with increasing frustration. naturally the last meeting we had which regrettably we didn't have as much time as i would have liked was to visit the soft force. it was inspirational. we saw it can work. you can bring that many different nations together to coordinate in a way that is effective. i guess my plea would be the soft forces over there try to spread

do the people have to? guest: the israelis and the palestinians, obviously, have a very major role to play since they are basically the main people concerned with this. nothing that is going to happen between the israelis and palestinians is going to happenoutside of the american context. the united states is obviously a very close ally of israel. it has always supported israel very strongly. it has always sought the best interest of israel materially and morally, the united states is supporting the israeli side. president obama is saying that he also wants to support the   palestinians, morally and materially. morally is very important. i think that is probably one of the most important things that he mentioned in his speech, the moral support of getting justice for the palestinians. without the united states come in one way or another, morally, physically, historically, politically in every way -- without the united states, i do not think we could expect anything major to happen between the israelis and thepalestinians. their role is very important and the role of the arabs is very important. i think that is something that he stressed in his speech in cairo. host: if you just joined us or are you -- or if you are listening on c-span radio, our guest is abderrahim foukara, the washington bureau chief for al jazeera arabic. our next call is vincent.   good morning. caller: good morning. the middle east did not have on the region did not have any oil. if there was no oil in the middle east, do you think that the united states would be so evasive and worrying about what we call human rights in the different countries? my basic comment is, i believe the united states has totally,absolutely been one-sided in this whole issue. we have not addressed with the united states has done with the shah because it was conducive to the united states. some people in the united states, we say that the muslims are terrorists. is in one man's terrorist another man's freedom fighter? when you allow israel to be able to do whatever they choose to   do and to allow the palestinians not to have their own sovereignty, if it was reversed the other way, we would be, it is terrible. i feel that the united states should come clean and say that the arabs have basically been a tribal people. they have had battles with the jews since the beginning of time. they will continue to have battles. why don't we be honest and say that the only reason we're there is because of fuel? the united states, if it doesnot need any fuel any more, we will see the truth of it. it is a shame. we should mind our business. when we say we really care about human rights, why do we trade with china? why do we go to saudi arabia? it is a shame what we do to the muslims. host: let me jump in on two   points. did the president not address that issue of nuclear weapons and also trying to solve -- to develop long-term peace? caller: absolutely not. president obama went there and was speaking to these people like children. who is the united states -- where we -- where did we get the audacity to go to other countries and dictate who can defend themselves, who can do this? we do not have that right.who put us in charge? regular americans shake their heads and say, who are we? we do not have the right to dictate these answers. if israel has military capabilities, who are we to say other countries do not? it is hypocrisy. if the middle east did not have any valuable oil, do you think we would really care?   i would like him to answer that. thank you. guest: the issue of oil is obviously very important. it is very important -- is a very important factor behind the involvement of the united states and other western powers in that part of the world. there is one phrase that the color used. that is tribal.the arabs have always been at the crossroads of human civilization. this is a major civilization. it has failed in modern times to produce the kind of results that would make of it a self sustaining, flourishing civilization. the president mentioned this in his speech yesterday.   this is a very important part of human civilization. with oil or without ol, people have always been interested in that part of the world, the middle east. there is one thing that i agree with the caller on. that is, why think it is a wonderful thing that the president of the united states has decided to actually go tocairo and deliver his speech to the muslim world from there and to the rest of the world. i think the policy part that he talked about. it is a little weird that 1 billion muslims, as he said in his speech, are sitting watching his speech, almost trying to find salvation in the speech of   an american president addressing them from cairo. they could do a lot more than wait for the president of a foreign power to come and deliver a speech to them about what should and what should not be done. he talked about scientific and education and how the united states would help them to achieve that, which is all laudable on the part of the president. i am not blaming the president himself.i am blaming the failings of the muslim world where you have 1 billion people, the inheritors of a grand civilization, waiting for someone to give them reassurance out of cairo host: this is barking quite a dialogue. another viewer is saying that president obama did not recruit people like hillary just for rhetoric. obama is serious about peace in he has almost four years to get it done.   good morning to you. caller: bid morning. i do not have that many things to say. i watched a documentary a couple of years ago. it was done by an american. he was talking about -- i guess the previous caller had never studied anthropology.these people were civilized. i am really sorry to hear him describe it as tribal. this documentarian interviewed a lot of people. it seemed that the general consensus among arab people is that they are at ground zero and their cultures have been   flattened. i was interested in any -- and the remark that your guest made about waiting for someone to come and deliver them. i think we have given too much unconditional support to israel. host: would you agree or disagree? guest: i would to a certainextent. the western powers do shoulder a large part of the responsibility for what is going on in some parts of the middle east. take the invasion of iraq, 2003. this is something that the president addressed in his speech. he did not apologize for it. he basically said that it was a war of choice. the outside world does have that   major part of the responsibility. when he talked about iran -- that was really interesting. he talked a lot about muslim civilization. when he talked about iran, he only talked about iran in the context of conflict. he did not talk about iran in acivilization of context. iran has a grand past civilization. the manifestations of it, you can still see today in iran anin culture. there's always going to be a debate as to how much the responsibility of the failings of the muslim world that the moslem world itself shoulders and how much the outside world shoulders. in the case of the   israeli/palestinian issue, the way i look at it is this way. you had a series of pogroms in eastern europe and then you have the holocaust for in the west tried to find some sort of grand historical compromise with judaism whereby a homeland for the jewish people is established in palestine.i think what the president -- these are very treacherous waters -- what the president is trying to do directly or indirectly is try to support that part of the debate about israel and palestine that says it is time now for the west to try to find a grand, historical compromise with islam and the muslim world by restoring some of the rights that the   palestinians have lost when they lost their land and their country in 1948. host: the president did talk about the horrors of a concentration camp. you can watch all of the president's events in cairo, egypt online. the president's news conference with german chancellor and also tomorrow, the events at normandy.the president's speech in cairo will read-share-air. joe is next. caller: good morning. i keep hearing -- first of, i think the president did the right thing. i think he delivered a very good speech. i am pleased that he spoke to a   majority of people in the united states. i have a problem hearing that extremist muslims are a very small minority amount of people there. i do not see that they're makingany money. i want to know how they are getting funded. they do not seem/r   there are a lot of extremists in the arab and muslim whorled rigid world. but muslims are over 1 billion people the greatest majority want to lead a peaceful life and do their own thing and look after their families and their children, of the same that people in the west what to do.or another in pakistan or in afghanistan or in iraq, obviously, that grabs attention. it grabs the attention of the media. it becomes the focal point of coverage. by becoming the focal point of coverage, the entire muslim region is suddenly seen through the prism of extremism and   terrorism. the reality of it is -- i do not have any numbers for how many extremists exist in any faith, but the reality of it is any faith, the majority of its adherents are people who just want to lead a peaceful life in a peaceful existence. host: dianne from new hampshire is saying that any consolatory language directed toward themuslim community would have been greeted with skepticism and derision by the right in this country? guest: it would have been greeted by derision -- greeted with derision by the right in this country. it has been greeted with derision by the right in the muslim world. that is something that was to be expected. if you hear the voices of what some muslims are saying about this speech being completely   useless for exacerbating the situation or going in that direction, that exists on both sides. when we were talking about president addressing three different constituencies, i am sure that he was worrying about that particular constituency here in the united states. he is override -- his overriding concern was to do what he feelsis best for america. the previous administration had an opportunity to do what it thought was best for america. now he is saying that it is my turn to play a vision -- a different vision. host: of a quote the financial times"" calling this a new beginning for the muslim world. ""usa today"" says that the u.s. is gaining ground in the battle for muslim hearts and minds.   butler, pennsylvania is our next caller. good morning. caller: good morning, gentlemen. i find you a tremendous breath of fresh air. your intellect is most impressive. my specific question for you, sir, will take you back. as you find your position in the united states, do you havedifficulty in dealing with subcurrents within the different countries in the middle east? host: what do you mean by some parents? -- subcurrents? caller: we seem to use the phrase arab world and muslim world interchangeably. there seems to be a conflict within the middle east between   the different ethnic groups as they break themselves out. my specific question is, how do you deal with that in aljazeera? are you pressured by individuals or governments to favor one side or the other? i will call them almost ethnic battles that seem to take place, more or less continuously in the middle east. guest: the issue of defining who is arab and jew is not is a verytricky one. overall, i would like to say that era is not a race. it is not an ethnic group. arabic is a way of being. you are absolutely right. if you travel across the arab world, you will find people who define themselves in a plethora of different ways.   that has always been the case in the middle east. incidentally, i really think that is part of the cultural diversity and richness. .has often described itself as a channel that sees the world through arab eyes. it is difficult to establish what those arab eyes are. but there is an error sensibility around big issues, like israel-palestine, like iraq, relations with iran fall   in a different category. this is a more clear-cut difference between arabs and persians. that does basically seem to unite people in the arab world from the atlantic to the gulf when it comes to issues between iraq and palestine. this is what we're getting right now. this is al jazeera.is there one version around the world? is it different here than elsewhere? guest: we are seeing al jazeera international or al jazeera english. there are two strands. there is one in arabic that is broadcast on satellite. you can see that i set like anywhere in the world. there is al jazeera english that is broadcast on cable. it is still trying to put itself   on cable on a large scale here in the united states. as of the first of july, they are going to beat on cable -- they are going to be on cable in the washington, d.c., area. these are two different strands. in many ways, they represent slightly different perspectives on the world.al jazeera arabic as the bulk of its audience in the middle east. it caters to be specifically arab audience in the middle east and elsewhere. al jazeera english has a broader perspective. it is broadcast in english. it addresses so many different audiences in various parts of the world, including the american audience.   host: we are talking to abderrahim foukara from al jazeera. jimmy is on the phone. caller: i have a concern about hypocrisy. barack obama goes abroad and talks about democracy. i find it fascinating because you do not have democracy in the united states.there is an issue in terms of the treatment of african american people in america. i wonder why al jazeera does not deal with the injustices for african-americans in the united states. guest: there is the issue of hypocrisy in the issue of what al jazeera covers in the united states. as far as democracy is concerned, i'm speaking as a non-americans living in the united states. the american political system is   an amazing political system treat it is capable of redress corrections. it has checks and balances, freedom of speech, the first amendment. it is obviously not the perfect political system. it does have its failings. we, in the arab world, clearly have a big deficit -- a big democratic deficit. while there is some hypocrisy inthe u.s. president going to preach democracy in the middle east while there are problems here in the united states, that does exist. but to compare the state of democracy in the arab world to the state of democracy in the united states is a major misleading or overreaching effort.   initially, the focus of al jazeera in the united states was washington, what happens politically in washington. we gradually started to widen the circle and cover things in other parts of the united states. we cover not just the political stuff. we try to cover social, cultural, religious topics, including the issue of race. we have covered the issue ofrace extensively during our extensive coverage of the election up to 2008, obviously. what happened in katrina was one aspect of it. what is creating reverberations about this issue of hypocrisy that the caller was talking about is when people in the middle east selling was going on in iraq after the invasion, the   chaos, and the effort by the bush administration to take democracy to iraq peepe. people then saw the issues around katrina. that caused confusion. how can a government with its own problems try to export democracy to other parts of the world and the middle east? i go back to my fundamental argument. that is that you cannot comparethe arab world with the united states in terms of democratic systems. >> this weekend, the midwest's   largest literary event. it is saturday, starting at 11:00 a.m. eastern throughout the day. there are panels on the economy, globalization and the american worker, homosexual rights, former illinois gov. rod blagojavich, the mob and counterfeiting, and a look at the graphic adaptation of ""working.""later, stanley greenberg is interviewed by sandy madeleine. bill ayers talks about his new book, a good race course against white supremacy -- ""racecourse against what supremacy.""   >> how is c-span funded?

[applause] and that is why a our union and others came together after the election to convene progressive organize this is a can we do the same thing after that we did before? can we get out of our silos andunderstand we have to share its strategy? we might have our own of this but we have to share a common agenda and a half to win an agenda together and maybe it won't be perfect but we have to figure out how to get their and if we have the most transracial president in my lifetime and maybe people who are older who might have had more chance -- transformation of president but we have to make them successful and make him to begin investing can be here and we have to figure out the inside and outside but our job is to be successful and make sure we   adopt an agenda that is good for all of us. a that is why unity 09 is all about, and table were progressive organizations to care about this thing come together and strategizing make sure we are the drumbeat across this country for change. i believe there's never been a time like this one, 60 votes with in the senate. but all of us who have begun to understand we can work together and there are more or less progressive sinsyne than ever could have dreamed of, andtogether we can all work side-by-side. sisters and brothers, i am incredibly excited about what's in front of us and yet their days i went up and say could he have done more are further out there, absolutely and i expect there will be more days like this but can i tell you that i'm so proud of what has been done already and so amazed about what he has been willing to do and put himself out there on the line.

[applause] >> want and serving our e-mail's in taking action, in is a pleasure to be here with this amazing panel and all of you today. especially with the good news we kenneling knowledge among the things that we have been thinking about constantly sincethe election. the age of barely oppositional politics is over. for now which is the best news that we have had in a long time here for eight years we have done an enormous amount accretive thinking about new ways to say, stop, no, wait, and sapphire in a crowded theater with the good news is well over doing that amazing organizations like center for community change, like seiu, and like all   of you who joined us that move on did oregon or fostering a vibrant endeavors progressive movement that has been able to take up the talents of our day because we do have a challenge. our job actually just not a lot more tricky. in just got a lot more tricky. while saying no matter how many different ways you have to sand is a lot more complicated than sophisticated strategy is to achieve progressive change and that is our challenge today. i would argue that we have three things to think about.watching the person
         
          to think about is matching artificial the economy is. the second one is getting back to the basis of democracy, one gives every american a voice in the process and then the third challenge that we have before us is winning the battle of the story, not finding the story of the battle. obama became president because he understood the culture on their toes that are important to   all american people and he was able to tell those stories over and over again. we have to take up that challenge and of a foreign. so starting with smashing artificial dichotomies -- how many of you have heard people say just four months after the election, we're back to business as usual in washington? i have. raise your hands. one of the things that has come to that is the idea that you areeither inside or outside of all due respect to roger i think our job is not to be inside or outside the take the doors of the images and smashed walls down. [applause] part of that comes from thinking you can either be with president obama or in against him and awfully reject that notion. president obama continues to enjoy a 70 percent approval rating because he is a chance from a figure with a vision that most americans really believe   and and in their neighborhoods to their elected representatives, we will never achieve that vision. the best guess that we can give to president obama and the next four years is a vibrant favors the local progressive movement that is with him and with theprogressive movement. [applause] the other piece of smashing artificial dichotomies is the idea we either need to support of the democrats of the opposition wins. we don't need the support of the democrats in the opposition would win, we need to actually hold members of congress accountable to that which americans voted them into office for a. [applause] one of the best examples of this is senator specter switching   parties. could move, give us another vote potentially gives us another vote. right? until he proves that he is going to vote with the value system of all of our constituency is it is okay. us to send we will support you if you vote for the employee free choice act, we will support you if you support a public health care option for all americans derrin [applause] if you do these we will come outfor you when you're up for reelection, if you don't all bets are off because you are accountable to your constituents in the american people. this is not a party line vote. similarly we have to get more sophisticated about how we work with all are democrats in congress. one example is the energy bill that just passed him to many. excellent effort. we lost a lot and the committee process here and there are some flaws of this bill that we hope   to strengthen to the floor process but one of the lessons that we learned in this is chairman henry waxman who is arguably one of the most passionate advocates of a clean energy economy was also the chief negotiator on the spell your hard to be a champion and a negotiator at the same time. what we as a movement did not recognize is we would be doing chairman waxman a favor by elevating voices from the progress of barack's, elevatingothers who have the ability because they were responsible forgetting a bill at committee to be that voice and say we can do more, there are more jobs possible if we commit more in this bill. a third dichotomy would like to smash is either hang together as a movement or fall apart. i'm a trained ecologist and i believe that the most vibrant ecosystems of the most diverse ecosystems. i believe that social change   ecology as well. we're so proud to be part of a new coalition effort called unity all nine, it is a form to help pass president obama's engine and is doing a great job. we're building current communities and states that are hard to build an, elevating non-traditional messengers and when it seiu weighed in on the energy bill to say, yes, we want these jobs that with so much more impact won't in many placesabout why we need a good energy bill and we're using our resources more efficiently because we know each other are doing. excellent effort and probably a part of it. at the same time our primary mandate is to represent our constituents and therefore if there comes a time where our constituents are not happy and members are not happy with the specific piece, it is okay for move on to step aside and push harder, it is okay for senator for community change to step   aside and push harder. when governor bredesen name was being floated in for the director of hhs, move on got up and said we don't think he is with us, we don't think he's going to represent our needs and we were -- one of the purse out the gate, there were others to do that as well, and we were very pleased now that we have a severely as in that position. [applause] i'm going to raise through the rest because i don't have time but the second point is gettingback to the basis of democracy -- this moment in time people have had bad taste of their voice smattering and we need to maximize that absolutely. we have got to simplifies the labyrinth of policy-making in the process of how we legislate as well as content of our legislation is very confusing. the onus is on us to actually simplify both the process and the content for all americans so they can weigh in at a per   betimes. who here has time to read isakson of the dupage draft of an energy bill that is fellow german? our job is to make sure that our members know what is in there and know how to make their voices heard. we need to hold all members of congress accountable. this goes back to your either with the democratic swear the opposition wins here and on the bankruptcy bill, we ran out the door the next day with senators who voted against the cramdown provision regardless of the fact they were democrats.i was an issue that affected all americans and we sent web videos to states to lead their constituents know how they voted. we will continue to report back to our members in these days about their representatives voting records and finally we need to elevate the voices of all americans in the process. one of the most successful actions we have done all year is when banking ceos went before the house financial oversight committee to defend their expenditure of millions of   taxpayer money and bonuses and corporate giants. we were able to get our members, if you want to ask a question before congress and them to us and we will get them to the representatives on the committee. 30,000 people responded and we can add those to the members of congress who were questioning the bank ceo's into things happen -- the main thing that happened is they read them, they read them and asked thequestions of these banking ceos but from that are members felt empowered, they have penetrated the walls of the use it in committee meetings and their voices were heard in them. and what we saw is congress people sitting with sheets of paper from their constituents without rich asking questions, they felt that an underage come out through their body and out to their voice and you can see them just by the fact they were sitting there with the voices of   anchor from their constituents. this is a two-way process and are members of congress gained strength when their constituents in putting into the process. finally we need to focus on winning the battle of the store and not finding the story as a battle. we have got to tell stories first and then backs. this is how president obama won the election, this is what brought us back to this chance farm in place which means we need to get out first and we need to manage the media. i'm out of time but i want to say one thing about the media --i know have lots of panels on the media but here's what we have noticed that the media is really interested in right now. where is the movement for entering on the left? who is against to? who is going to be the first one out against president obama and a little of what we like to call hot democratic on democratic action. [laughter] we never get more press and we go after the democrats. we all were to gather into actually elevate that tabloid journalism back to the basis of the stories of what america's --   americans need and want, that is where our to strength lies so i will leave you with this thought. the best if we can give to our new president is a strong vibrant movement committed to smashing artificial dichotomies, winning the battle of the story, and getting back to the basics of democracy there and i would posit as i leave you that our country will never go back to where we are here and we have achieved unthinkable gains in the last year.a year ago it was a dream that barak obama would be president, and what is even more special than that is that hundreds of millions of americans feel like they had a peace in that and if we continue to tap into that, the potential of this political moment is staggering. so i invite you all to join all of us in that challenge. [applause]   >> is this not a great panel? this is terrific. deepak bhargava is executive director of the center for community change. he has been the center all about grass roots community organizing and organizing to change public policy to improve the lives of poor people there and he's made the center a leader on immigration reform, helping to build it there immigration reform movement. many of those folks are here andwill be joining us tomorrow. i hope all of you will come on tuesday night's awards dinner where deepak and the center for community change will receive our paul wellstone progressive leadership award. [applause] please welcome deepak bhargava. [applause] >> this morning.   >> good morning. >> i want to thank roger in this incredible panel hearing is a great honor to be with you today. the so what is the progress of a challenge ahead of us? as i see it, it has two dimensions, is going to sound like i'm about to contradict myself when i talk a lot to dimensions but where with name. the first dimension is that we have to win now and have to win right and the second to mention is that we're going to have to build of the ideas come in theinfrastructure it will take to put in place progressive baroness for decades to come. so winning now when a right -- what is that about? john maynard keynes, an economist i am fanon who is coming in. >> -- coming back into popularity is famous for having sat in the long run we're all dead. [laughter] and i this in this moment i think he would have meant that we have a once-in-a-lifetime   opportunity to advance a progressive policy change in our country. there really is no time for foolishness. that we have to throw everything we have at the situation at hand to ensure the transfer of an agenda on the critical issues facing our country are enacted into law. so what does it mean to win out in to win right? well, i think it means first focusing on issues where winning will consolidate and held to a man's progress of power and inmy mind there are three issues that fit that bill -- health care reform which if we succeeded will dramatically change the role of government and the lives of every single person in the united states of america and rebuild confidence and trust that we can solve a major social problems, that we can have a positive role for government in the economy in our society. second, the best teenineteen. which will restore the rights of   workers to organize and to choose to join the union. this is good public policy and also smart because of the labor movement is fundamental to any kind of progressive movement in the united states, it always has been and always will be. in the third pillar i would argue is comprehensive immigration reform. the president has said that he wants to get this done. the argument for this on moral ground is crystal clear -- wehave 12 million people in our society who are operating and living in the shadows, living in terror that any time at any moment they can be picked up at the worksite or at home and separated from their loved ones. we have had mother separated from their children, we have had brothers separated from their sisters, this has been a brutal policy that we have had over the last eight years. but it is also import from the perspective of building progress of power because those   12 million undocumented immigrants if we are successful in treating a path to citizenship will join in a larger progressive coalition on all the fights for economic and social justice and a loss. we not only need to win the state's progressive challenges and price ahead of us, we need to win the right. and what i mean by this is that our obligation as progressives is to fight for principles that we hold dear. we're ultimately about thepeople that we represent and so in the context of health care that means be relentless about fighting for a public plan option for every single american in the united states of america. [applause] it also means making sure that we address issues like racial disparities and access to health care. [applause] making sure that immigrants are not left out of health care and making sure that the poor and medicaid are protected.   all of that is consistent with being a progressives and we have a an obligation to fight like hell to make sure it happens. in order to win out and to win right, we are going to keep organizing. the truth is that we would be doing our first community organizer and chief a terrible disservice by diluting our sell some thinking that this is about his ability to deliver for us and about whether he is stepping up to the plate in being asaggressive as we want him to me -- it really is about our ability to read the kind of public will in the country to create the kind of demand for the progressive policy change that makes it inevitable i think the last piece of this challenge for us is going to be to make suffering visible in america. so i am struck everywhere i travel in this country working with low-income grassroots organizations the there is a   social catastrophe happened in our country, so we have millions of people were being put out of their homes, we have millions of people who are losing their jobs with no adequate safety net whatsoever, and there's almost no discussion of this and the pundit class and wilson washington dc. it is our job to make that discussion front and center unavoidable every single day in washington in the scene. [applause] so that takes me to our secondtask as we look at this new era we are in which used to build a bold longer-term agenda for change. now, i will confess after the election i thought in terms of those game show contests that people used to win for you get 10 minutes in a grocery store and anything you put into your shopping cart you could take home some of the we could get health care reform and put that in a basket, maybe we could get immigration reform and put that in the basket, maybe some good   party provision, but then sooner later that 10 minute time would be up and we would be back to consider the politics and policies as usual here like that was the wrong way to think about the moment we are in. we could be in a situation where we can create a cycle where winning progressive policy change allows us to win more progressive policy change. and today we have been really dealing with a brightly and fighting for policy ideas thatin some ways are off the shelf and. these are things we have been fighting for for a long time but these are issues that have been blocked by the conservative dominance of this town. but there are new issues that we need to begin to lay the groundwork for an emerging issues to the groundwork for, and we for is some of that morning hearing about the need to create a new kind of economy that works for everybody. we are seeing levels of inequality and poverty and racial exclusion of our country that are fundamentally   incompatible with a thriving economy or democracy. people used to say that any quality of the time that we have in our country today is the necessary consequence of a capitalist economy and a growth economy that we have to live with the reality here and if there's one lesson that this crisis has tossed in a savage inequality is actually bad for the a lot -- bad for the economy and bad for our democracy brianna [applause]so in my mind one of the worsens that has happened over the time of conservative dominance is that it has taken all subjects and put them outside the pale of polite discourse among elites in our country, issues on a deep poverty and unemployment and radical income inequality so we are going to need over these next couple of years to build an even bigger agenda that ask questions about how much inequality is acceptable in our country, what is the role of the corporation in our country so   that in 2011 and 2013 we are not just resting on the mall so what we have done in 2009 and 2010 but pushing for more the final point i want to make is that in some ways the big question for this time i think for this time is whether this will be a time when the new deal and in the new deal we saw on not just a short burst of progress of policy-making, but really asustained campaign to get policy change down over many years and and and the second two years of the new deal or far more far reaching in social security, the weiner act and the first two years. in my mind a question for us is will we have the kind of sustained a series of breakthroughs over multiple years or will we have a narrow window to get our shopping cart build up?   and the answer that question is enough to president obama, it is up to us. thank you very much. [applause] >> this has been a great piano, a great group of speakers and great group of leaders. we have caught up a little bit in terms of our time so we have a little bit
         
          to have a discussion here and i don't know if any of our speakers want tohave an exchange or ask some questions with our other panelists? i'm sorry, we did not prepare for that, we will get to you in a second to hear and let me make an interesting comparison between the two efforts on health care health care and have a conversation about how we do   parallel paths. mitch, you send the there were three principles guiding the effort by organizing for america merited there is a larger coalition called health care for american now which is lying great emphasis on the need for a public plan. we have taken the responsibility forgetting members of congress to step up to that hearing aid is in the plan in that obamacampaign on, it certainly aims at controlling costs in the way that he has made that a priority but my guess is that organizing for american decided they need to be a little more general. sacrificing perhaps the intensity on the part of your supporters, but preparing for the possibility that it might or might not get into the   legislation. on the other hand, in whole bunch of us are fighting like crazy to make sure that it is in that legislation.

do you believe we should recall -- require that the courts grant automatic deference? that is the standard in the senate companion bill, but not this one. >> when i was here before the   house judiciary committee last year, you did not have a bill yet. we were talking about principles and legislation. one of the then administration officials raised the proposal that at most different beat the standard. i said there were other places in legislation like exemption401that use substantial way. i believe i also attached to that what i later said in a supplemental letter that went to the house judiciary committee, i meant the same kind of wheat that any expert witness gets. he defines substantial weight as   only the weight that is the proper it by that demonstration of qualifications and expertise. >> you think the language in that -- >> i like the language in the current bill better. i think it is confusing. >> if that is adequate to account for government expertise, what are the risks, if any of putting in language,why shouldn't we do that? >> i think that the basic principle, the one that was endorsed by the supreme court in reynolds, it is the judge should be the decision maker as to whether it a privilege applies. he ought to make an appear -- a -- and an independent assessment. it takes away that from the   underlying principle. >> congressman hutchinson come those who oppose often argue that it is the president of the executive branch, not the court that has greater expertise and responsibility for safeguarding national security. did you underestimate the responsibility of the courts inour cost digital scheme, your testimony says york times to overstate to avoid exposure, does the argument also overlook the potential conflict for the government in the case with the information that seeks to withhold information that might be embarrassing or provide information about illegal conduct? >> the key point is that we have   to give the courts but tools and a guidance to ensure an independent review. any language, such as substantial deference would undermine that independent review in terms of the ability of the courts to wait expert testimony, that is what is marvelous about our judiciary and our rule of law in our country, is that you can have ajudiciary -- they don't have to be experts on patent law to make of decision, or an expert in the engineering to make, i would trust the expertise of the courts, under normal guidelines, what is presented. >> in cases you have handled, the government has argued that the entire subject matter like rendition and torture are still secret.   >> this is a valuable war -- tool in the war on terror. in view of these facts, what do we make of the government's back -- of all right dismissal of cases? >> it is evidence that the government's approach to secrecy is somewhat more opportunist -- opportunistic.on the day i responded to government -- attorneys that it should be thrown out on, it was discovered that three individuals were water boarded. when it finds itself in the position of being a defendant in   the case, it becomes a secret. >> why should the government be required to prove item by item that exposure to expect -- particular information, why isn't it sufficient to except as risible the government's assertion that in its view of litigation would provide -- revealed litigation and it justifies the initial pleating stage? >> judges are not clear for it.they are not in a position at the beginning of a litigation to determine what evidence will or will not be necessary for the parties to make to prove their claim. when that argument is being advanced by an executive-branch official, who stands to gain, i think courts need to be even more wary about it because of the inherent conflict of interest.   a court cannot know at the outset that a plaintiff will not be able to come up without an alternative means without recourse. >> thank you very much. that concludes my question for the moment. i now recognize the former chairman of the committee for five minutes. let's i have a quote from yourtestimony from january 29th, where you talk specifically about substantial weight being given to government assertion. you seem to approve of that. you also quoted a satchel that requires the court to give substantial weight when someone is trying to get information under the freedom of information act. have you changed your mind this   last year on the subject? >> i have not changed my mind. perhaps i am in the close group of people currently, who wished they had stated things a little bit more clearly the first time around. on this particular thing, as i pointed out, there was not any bill or anything we werefocusing on specifically when talking about principles. when i talked about weight, i used it as an example of a standard that was an exemption. i want to make one thing clear. it isn't even in the the text. it is only in the conference committee report. we don't have an example where is in the statute. many judges have cited it from the conference report.   it was in the legislative history. i did use substantial weight, in my view in looking at the phrase, i interpreted the with the judge writes it, i put that quote in there today which says it does not mean some kind of blanket notion, that when thewitness comes and says, i represent the government, he or she immediately gets deference. it means according to the judge, it means that you get the kind of waite, special weight from the judge that the qualifications, experience, and coherence of the testimony of -- to render it.   >> let me pursue this further. even if you essex let -- except the legislative history, it seems to meet the type ofmaterial usually requested is much less sensitive than out material, where an allegation of the state secret is asserted by the government. doesn't it concern you that you would be having different standards, that we have different kinds of ways that could be accorded to government assertions when records or   information are attempted to be sought from the government? >> number one, i am not sure. i do not have the experience although i encountered those kinds of cases on the bench. i do not have the experience to validate what you say that some of state secrets are set some how to involve much more sensitive material.my chief experience -- there was sensitive materials that were raised in some of those cases, including the aborted a helicopter rescue of the people at the end of the carter administration. i want to make another point, and that is that the jefferson case, it specifically addressed   and pointed out that they believe that different standards might be appropriate. what is at stake in employee exemption one is a citizen wanted to get the information, not having to show any particularly -- particular injury in the balance of equities. on the other hand, if you are in a civil case, whether it is anallegation of injury, the stakes are much more important. i am not sure. i want to point out that judges have interpreted this differently. sometimes, they will even look at the material and take the government's affidavit at face -- value. others say, it will not make sense to me. >> that gets to my final   question. currently, we do have a body of law with a substantially different standards that is in the current law. that basically makes this a matter of judicial discretion. aren't we likely to get, what isthe legend acclaim for information, if we start to scratch on what the case law should be? >> i think not. i don't think you have a consistent body of lot -- lock, with a consistent standard now. i think it is all over the map.   we could almost begin a new with the standard, and begin to build that body. i don't think we will lose anything inconsistency from the current law. >> since i know the president and attorney general better than anybody in this room, could youexplain to me why the president is so ambivalent, and why the attorney general did not send anyone to this hearing? >> who is that addressed to? >> anybody. >> when the senate chair -- when   president obama was in the senate, and campaigning, he had a very different position on the state secrets privilege. now that he is in the executive branch, now that he has seen the usefulness and utility of its, he seems to have reached a very different view. i can understand that might be politically inconvenient, but i think there is some evidence that is what has occurred. >> i was afraid you would be the one who would answer myquestion. >> mr. grossman indicated there was some evidence. what is that evidence? or are you speculate? >> i am speculating, based on. >> that's fine. no, please go ahead. >> when they were in the senate, both senator biden and senator obama were both critics of the state secrets privilege.   since assuming office, the administration has used the privilege in at least three cases that we are aware. all three of those cases were very controversial in vocations of privilege. the cases that have resulted in much of the -- in this congress, as well as in the public theater. essentially, it is speculation.i have not asked anyone in the executive branch what their thinking on this is, but a reasonable conclusion can be drawn by what has exit occurred. >> can you explain the attorney general's failure to provide a witness? >> no. >> anyone else want to weigh in on this? >> i will to say, i appreciate the fact that the attorney   general is looking within the executive branch as to refining their internal procedures of the assertion of the state privileges doctrine. to me, that raises the profile, especially in congress come to act. whether here or not, they are working on their branch of government. i am glad that congress is considering it at the sun time, more comprehensive reform. >> we are the two people whoraise the question of unconstitutionality. what do you think about the unconstitutional charge on this measure? ike >> i share the opinion with a judge. i would only add that my   understanding of the argument that this bill would be unconstitutional would apply equal force to the freedom of information act, and to the classified information procedures act. they give courts tools to handle sensitive intimation, and create procedures for courts to do that. none of those entered on the president's constitutional authority.>> i certainly agree with what mr. wiseman said. all privileges, many privileges have tinges of constitutionality about executive privilege. if we could all go back and say that we need this, we have to have more power in order to for felt the commander in chief powers.   i think that these privileges have been considered to be susceptible to congressional concern, going back to 1969, when we were going to have federal rules of evidence with more details. there was one drafted to deal with state secrets per fro -- privilege, then congress abandoned the attempt to have a very specific set of codes on it. i don't think the supreme courtin reynolds or anyplace else suggested that this was some kind of sacrosanct constitutional privilege i could not be touched. >> i think the argument is that somehow legislating in this area impedes the executive from his national security responsibility of protecting our country. i don't see any challenge to   that authority at all, the legislation being considered doesn't stop them from exercising state secrets from implementing national security programs, it doesn't change the fact that they can assert that privilege. it just says that when it gets to the court, after the fact always, when it will be reviewed, then there will be a process in our system of checks and balances. i did not see this as takingaway from the authority of the chief executive come in terms of national security. >> while we were in court, you would be on the short end of this discussion. >> that is true numerically speaking. i think if you look at the supreme court's decisions in chicago, nixon, and others, the   court has said that secrecy is in some demands unnecessary incidents to the commander-in- chief power. those powers cannot be fully exercised without a strong degree of secrecy. the court has actually said that the executive has the constitutional power to control access to classified information. who is just for the enough to receive certain types ofclassified information? , particularly in affairs. parks it for that reason, it would be unconstitutional. >> the supreme court in these cases has said that secrecy is inherent in the executive, but it is true is it not, that the   supreme court has always said that these powers are limited and not absolute. no executive power, no congressional power is absolute. >> you are correct. at the same time, no power is -- either. >> this bill does not avoid anything. it's simply suggest executivepowers of secrecy in the context of court cases is supervision by the court. and to altman approval by the court. -- and to the ultimate approval by the court. congress's power under article one to regulate evidence and the administration of evidence has   been granted power. >> that grant of power is unlimited. >> you would argue that a general power supersedes a random power? >> this body could not abrogate systematic privilege against self-incrimination, despite its power to regulate --. >> you are reversing that. >> i would disagree.the constitution cites the executive and constitutional power to the president. if secrecy is unnecessary incidents of that power, that is, the president's power. >> ok. mr. grossman, if we were in court, i would ask you to come back to chambers after we were finished. i appreciate your constructive a temps to defend your proposition.   i yield back, mr. chairman. >> i recognize the gentleman from iowa for five minutes. >> thank you. i would like to compliment you of the nimble response to the chairman of the full committee. at first, i'd like to ask mr. hutchinson as i was able to hear most of the testimony here, andlook back over the history of this country and wonder when it is i have been alarmed at the state's secrets document says or cause someone to lose their rights or privacy, or made the nation less safe. was there anything in history that we were not able to learn from, because it was rolled up in an executive privilege? my question is, what are we trying to fix?   >> i am not coming to this hearing in a critical fashion. others have had different experiences. i am coming to this from the standpoint that regardless of the history of it, we have a responsibility to make sure that the potential for abuse is minimize by a system of checks and balances. ike come at this as a conservative. i do not believe that anunfettered unchecked excel -- executive branch. we all have checks and balances. here is an executive can assert state secrets privilege, without any review, with broad authority, unbridled authority. i think this goes against the principles of our founding fathers. >> i appreciate that.   just a point of intermission as a longtime member of congress, if you have ever gone into a classified hearing, given up your blackberry and cell phone and come back and recover that and then stepped in front of a television screen and seen the similar briefing coming out on the news summit -- simultaneously, like all of us have.>> your point is well taken, that there is a history. there are other branches of government have spoken about what has been classified information, the knicks -- the executive branch excels in that. i think the track record for the court is totally different. they don't have to stand for   federal election and the judiciary. they have a track record that is extraordinary and protecting classified information. >> i agree with that point. i am glad it was brought out again. in light of the nimble nature that you have responded to previous questions or comments,can you address this panel on the limits or scope of the exit -- existing executive privilege? if there was a white house that had contracted with an enterprise that had the trappings of a criminal enterprise to engage as a contractor into working with developing the senses, which happens every 10 years here in the united states. if the result of that census   might dramatically change the congressional districts, change the political dynamics, and if that enterprise appeared to be a criminal enterprise, or something that happened to be supportive of turning out the vote for that white house, would you be able to assert an executivevi","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN : June 5, 2009 1:00pm-1:30pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

will yield back. . .   that it reflects many years of input from members. i thought that john angles, it is almost old enough to vote was particularly apt and that applies to me to.and i think coming from a state like california witches of the largest agricultural producer in the country, we ignore food safety at our peril. the vice chairman, diana, was chronicling some of the recent outbreaks and how important it is two have traceability and mandatory recall, i agree, and they could have saved a lot of pain, a lot of cost and a lot of   health problems had had those measures in place so i just want to include by saying that we have an able and willing partner facing us this morning. and i think we have an able and willing committee on a bipartisan basis to engage with her and i'm very eager to see us make progress and in that legislation close to the committee draft as soon as possible. its international interest and surely as we talk about grandchildren it is in our grandchildren's interests, iyield back the balance of my time. >> thank-you. the gentlewoman from tennessee, mr. blackburn. >> thank you mr. chairman and i want to well, dr. tim jones who is going to be on our second panel. he is hiding over. the back. you must be one of the baptists from tennessee, sitting in the back row until time for him to come forward, but dr. jones is an epidemiologist with the department of health in our   great state. does a wonderful job for our state and i'm absolutely delighted we're going to be able to hear from him today on the second panel so dr. jones thank you for taking the time to tom. while the draft legislation before us attempts to improve the safety and efficacy of the nation's food supply it appears a there is still a lot of room for improvement in am appreciative that we're having the hearing and i am hopeful that we are going to be able to work in a bipartisan way on thisissue. i appreciate the majority's attempt to improve the food safety system, but i think that we all know especially those of us who are mothers, we know that you can't inspect your way to food safety. we know that this legislation is going to have to do more than be reactive. this legislation broadly increases the speed to authority to make it one of the largest   federal agencies in the existence. my concern is the growth of bureaucracy and what is going to happen in and that bureaucracy and groce. what i do think is necessary and i think it is necessary that our system be at risk based, that it be preventative and take that approach, and that it attractively targets bad actors. it's imperative that resources are focused on high risk in ainnovation and, however, this bill places undue burden on small businesses and they would be harmed by burdensome and expensive provisions that are found in this current draft legislation. the fda has provided no evidence that it has improved its internal processes in order to improve the review of the nation's food supply. this is something we have talked   about endlessly in this committee and in hearing so we are looking for to having some questions on this. there seems to be and you haven't proven otherwise that there are established protocols and lines of communication between different jurisdictions. you have not shown that there are best practices in been about 13 months ago i asked for a list of best practices on its triagency communication and how you are sharing this information, how you are workingwith your affiliate's so that everyone can more easily pinpoint and get to the bottom of the problems and bad actors and issues that are coming forward. yesterday the fda announced they are studying ways to make agency more transparent. this should of been done before we passed the bill that would give the agency millions of dollars in user fees and i'm going to yield my time back and said that michael statement for   the record and report to the questions. >> thank-you, the gentlewoman from the virgin islands, ms. christensen. >> thank you mr. chairman and welcome back dr. hamburg. i know at new yorkers suffered a great loss but the nation needs a more accurate and i also think it is refitting as we come back to congress and begin to put the nuts and bolts on our health care reform legislation the first hearing is with fda because i believe we'll began not with an overhaul and betterresource in a separate and drug administration, from the food safety enhancement act that we're looking at and drafted and and the family smoking and control act of 2009 looking at a new fda and have the talent and the opportunity to make this important institution in ways better serve the health of the american public also fostering, guiding and supporting the bringing a new and better treatment to us as well. i have confidence in a better   race doris fda with more authority and one that is not overly prescriptive. i don't want to be overly prescriptive on what we tell the agency to do but hope we can allow to do is john based on a clear authority, adequate resources and sound science. in the case of food safety in this my first three months on this committee by been alarmed to find out what has happened that has put the public's health in jeopardy from salmonella tosome questions about even the irb process and several other areas so we're here to help to treat a better come up stronger fda in this hearing is part of that and i thank you and all of the panelists were sharing their experience and expertise with us this morning. >> thank you, the gentleman from pennsylvania, mr. murphy. >> thank you mr. chairman and welcome dr. hamburg. pennsylvania's industry is agriculture and that comes food-processing and.   we're honored to have national companies like hershey's, companies like welshes that grows grapes and more locally in the pittsburgh area regional distributors like giant eagle, national distributors and, of course, big bands like del monte and corporate headquarters of heinz. and small companies like sears chocolate the cells around the country. all of them have talked with us about concerns for this bill and certainly are very supportive to make sure we have strong fda and we want to make sure that happens. a few questions are raised and ihope i can remain for part of the hearing so i will have to leave for the floor but a number of issues making sure there is no one intended consequences that leads to increased price for consumers but work on the registration fee particularly as a man at smaller businesses. also with regard to the traceability, we need to be clear what the obligations are for the process and fresh food industry -- traceability of every an agreement that went to   the product. for example of a local restaurant chain makes cookies trying to track every single ingredient that comes up with its pacific food colored dye may be a problem with them and like to make sure we make that work for the safety of consumers but not in a way that impairs companies from doing their work and also unintended consequences of giving copies of all test results could be less testing. as companies go through lots of tests for products that nevermake it to market, would it be to test hundreds of samples each day to be available or a change to the testing of products in the marketplace. with regard to the country of origin labeling and disclosure, to list every increase in on a website will increase the cost of resources and not necessarily bring added value and the recent general levels such as the same and this product may contain ingredients from one or more of the following countries.   also praising them for as of making sure all enforcement standards and the officers and auditors are well-trained and calibrated to work to define audit standards. there is concern about happens with the family farm that sells a local grocery stores and what level they would have to comply and would it be that the fees for them would be so high they simply could not sell any product outside of their own farm store and does that compare small distributors, how do we help them.another issue, one of them a package food at the stores such as some value add ground beef products made in their meat departments, what happens if they make some other foods at the store and how this that affect them in other way is. so certainly in pennsylvania we want strong at food safety bills and protect consumers and small businesses to be encouraged and large businesses supported but encourage new startups but more than anything we want the penguins to win the stanley cup and i yield back.   [laughter] >> thank you. the gentleman from texas, mr. braley. >> mr. chairman, wanted thank you for holding the hearing on the discussion draft of the food safety legislation, there have been high profile contamination incidents in the united states including peanut butter and tim nato and this committee is investigating these incidents. these hearings on the fda have clearly shown us that it does not have the resources, findingour manpower and technology to protect american food supply and fulfill its mission. chairman dingell, and in peanut butter have worked on this issue. i am hopeful the riss hearing and discussion draft will bring us one step closer and passing food safety legislation out of the house. i have a brief chance to review this and briefly discuss a couple of issues that concern me -- it allows for food imports   and to be inspected by labs to conduct sample analysis and i support the provision go live to see an investment in construction of fda labs and the port of houston is the largest in terms of foreign and improves our energy industry by the import of 606,000 tons of imported food in 2007, the port of houston does not have a fda lab and surprising no fda laugh-in taxes even though weshare the longest border with mexico. i have yet to understand texas with its level of trade it does not have a fda lab and, in fact, there are over 300 ports of entry in the u.s. and only 13 parts and chile have fda labs. i hope my colleagues will forgive me but the close the fda in lab empire state of texas located in arkansas. in houston isn't the only import area and texas and cities like laredo is one of the largest   block ports of entry in the world imports from mexico literally trailers, thousands of travelers on a weekly basis. it seems unwise and unsafe to have the lab for the empire state of texas hundreds of miles away in another state, the location of labs need to be evaluated and reports submitted to congress on whether the labs are located where they are most needed a. discussion draft allows fda to assess current lab locations andrelocate labs as necessary and i like to hear from the fda on whether they have plans to evaluate current locations. congress also is to allocate funds to the building of more fda labs and employees to see the budget allocation of funds for laughs so it insures the food supply of any to build more labs in areas where food imports are arriving such as houston's of the fda can quickly and accurately test our food imports and ensure food safety.   thank you mr. chairman and i look for to hearing our witnesses and thank you again, our new fda director for appearing before the committee can i thank you mr. green. ranking member, mr. barton. >> thank you mr. chairman, i will be very brief. we support their being legislative hearing and hearing on his safety. we think it is time to digestthis problem in a bipartisan fashion it at all possible and to think it is important we try to get right it at all possible. we understand that it is your wish and the full committee chairman swished and former chairman dingell's wished to move with legislation sometime this month, republicans are ready to help. if we can't agree on a bill that provides a the fda with the tools that it needs to ensure the safety of our food supply,   but we will not support new blanket authority is that are designed merely to empower the bureaucracy. nearly everybody says that quote, we cannot inspector way to safety, and many systems that reliably prevent sickness by applying resources in those places that are most susceptible to contamination. the draft before us proposes several areas to strengthen prevention of food analyst outbreak, such as requiring allmanufacturers to have food safety plans and also the creation of appropriate to produce standards. these ideas make sense and have universal support. we are concerned however, the parts of the draft and more weight than quality to the regulations and in our opinion provide too much discretion to the fda. without any corresponding facility benefit. for example, country of origin labeling is not about food   safety, as a practical matter will simply increase the cost of groceries at the store. we know this because expert has testified at the committee that this provision is absolutely no effect on safety. there are several other specific concerns with the draft including the level and scope of the registration fees. i will say that the registration fees are less in this draft than the have been in some previous drafts so i can at least a we are moving in the rightdirection. having said that, it doesn't appear -- it does appear that the majority simply wants 300 to $400 million in additional funds for the fda and we can't see that there is a clear purpose for that amount of funding. having said that, we look for in to the hearings and if we can work on some of these problems we are prepared to be positively   engaged in the markup that comes after the hearings. with that, mr. chairman, wheeled back. >> thank you mr. barton. the gentleman from ohio, miss austen. >> thank you mr. chairman, thank-you for holding this hearing on the six or nearly a issue. i want to extend my appreciation to the sponsor of this bill and all of those who for so longhave been fighting the fight to fix our food safety system and make sure that the food that is on the table to feed their families is a for their consumption and that which goes to them to school, they can fear not that it will be safe for their children to eat. tehran -- chairman emeritus dingell, i thank you for your efforts in improving our food safety net or along with representative dingell, chairman   stupak and others on both sides of the aisle, and look for and to working with you. as you may know, the very for his bill i introduced in the house i believe was a bill that called for mandatory recall authority for the fda, and there's a reason for that. we have seen these problems arise again and again and again within our food safety network and the american people i think would have been shot as i was tolearn that our government does not have the authority to issue a mandatory recall when it became apparent that it was necessary. ohio has suffered the a fax of problems with our lives a system, most recently the salmonella outbreak has climbed lives and harmed many throughout the buckeye state. it is critical that we are moving forward with a comprehensive bill to finally address and ensure the safety of   america's tables and our system. thank you so much, i yield back. >> thank-you. gentleman from michigan, mr. rogers. >> thank you mr. chairman, congratulations commissioner, breyer confirmation and i look forward to working with you on the difficult issues ahead. i'm glad we're focused on food safety and we can all agree that the fda needs more resources to protect the food supply and strengthen public health. i am concerned however, this might be a ready shoot a manevent, we just passed a fairly onerous bell and added authority to the fda that had a huge loophole in it that allow tobacco regulation to be barred from the general fund of the fda. so you have this whole of it millions and millions of dollars of which are going to have to try to apply to thousands and thousands of the regulators at the same time try to improve food safety and i can't think of anything more important than our   food supply -- by hat is off to you commissioner on the challenge of what you have accepted it as we all know the fda is currently unable to inspect the majority of the facilities. worse many high-risk facilities have gone without inspection and oversight at all. we have seen the impact of this failure with numerous salmonella and e. coli outbreaks which have sickened thousands and even lead to death. i hope that this bill can eventually be a bipartisan bill however many of the concerns that we have expressed have notbeen addressed and we have not have the opportunity to sit down and have a discussion before this bill has come before the committee and that's horribly unfortunate when talking about food safety and issues. the user fees in this draft are concerning to me, as written it would require $1,000 and registration fee for food facility with the funds totaling three and $75 million which will be passed along to consumers which are regular families time to pay their bills already,   there is nothing in there that dedicates this to new inspections so we've come up a new tax regiment that doesn't benefit to the fda in getting into the place where you need it most which his inspectors for food facilities and food supply. it makes no sense to me and that's something we have to change in this bill or madam commissioner you are going to look at a tough call to fill again. there's nothing in here that tell separators where to put that money so that you can best use it to accomplish the mission of which this will tell you andhas to do without telling where the money's coming from. that's the most dangerous when you think about this plus the fda tobacco regulation authority that allows them to take your money for food supply inspections and drug approval and use it for hiring new regulators for tobacco. that's a real problem that we need to fix on only in this bill at least i hope it can. and food producers are required to pay this new tax they should absolutely have the certainty the funds will be used for food   safety inspections. i think that is common sense and we can all agree that i hope toรง work with the majority to get that taken care of. the draft inspection schedule seems almost impossible to achieve it. today at home commissioner that you can shed some light on whether a practical of risk based inspection schedule should look like and i hope you can cover that today in your statement and to questions. also have several other concerns, the new broad recallauthorities important but how is done is incredibly important and expansive new civil penalty regime, new labeling requirements the don't seem to have anything to do with food safety. i think all of these issues we can address if we were together in a bipartisan manner and i think, around something we can all believe needs to happen and that is more resources for inspection and food safety regimes that this be two has a primary responsibility for. i look for to working with you   and thank you mr. chairman for this i think all import hearing. >> they give mr. rogers. the gentleman from as consummate, miss baldwin. >> thank you mr. chairman, i appreciate the fact you're holding today's hearing and wanted judge my colleagues in commending you and chairman steve packin and chairman emeritus dingell for putting this a very important discussion draft before us that addressesthe very serious challenges that we face with respect to food safety. before i begin my remarks i like to submit for the record written testimony from the secretary of the department of agriculture trade and consumer protection in the state of wisconsin. >> without objection so ordered. >> thank you mr. chairman. food safety is an issue of great concern to me and my constituents. approximately one in four people in this country are affected or sickened by foodborne disease   each year. as americans we rely on government to keep a safe and as government we have fallen down on the job. as we consider this draft legislation, i know that our goal is to empower the fda to prevent food contamination incidents before they occur. i hope that we do so with appropriate and sufficient resources, but also with precise coordination between other federal agencies, the states andthe private sector. currently with its limited resources this fda focuses its inspections on large manufacturers engaged in interstate commerce and it leaves much of the front line where to the states. this bill creates a risk based inspection system that significantly increases the frequency of inspections here and i want to make sure that we are not duplicating efforts and that we can empower states to perform their work on the ground   with logistical and financial support. i urge the fda to use this legislation to create a stronger or integrated who say the system that leverage the state and local resources. another -- as another result of a limited resources fda relies on and many private sector firms to conduct food safety tasting -- testing on a contractual basis. i am pleased to the discussion draft includes a provision thatwould allow a laboratory accreditation process, facilitating the fda's use of third-party lavatories to perform testing and want to make sure that the conflict of interest language in the bill does not prevent some of the most experienced laboratories plummeted their strong partnership with the fda moving forward. i look for to hearing your testimony dr. hamburg and that of the other witnesses tonight and i thank you again mr. chairman for this hearing him and thank you. gentleman from georgia,.   >> thank you mr. chairman, mr. chairman, public health officials estimated that 76 million people become sick, 325,000 are actually hospitalized and 5,000 die each year from foodborne illnesses caused by contamination. incidents like those in my own home state of georgia where the actions of the few bad actors and a breakdown in effect of government oversight sickenedmore than 677 people in 45 states and caused at least nine deaths, underscores the need for action. i agree with my colleagues that more news to be done to ensure that the food products of american consumers are safe. additionally i support the efforts of this committee as it reviews with to streamline and improve the food inspection system in this country. mr. chairman, i hope that these hearings will continue to allow us the opportunity to reflect on   the brink towns in our current system as well as their purpose solutions to safeguard the health and welfare of all americans. madam commissioner, i commend you for your recent appointment of an accord to hearing from you and the next panel of witnesses and with that mr. chairman, i yield back him and thank you. the gentleman from iowa, mr. braley. >> thank you dr. hamburg, i don't think anyone sitting here as anything but good wishes foryou and the enormous challenges you face and we wish you well and look for to many fruitful and productive conversations with you. as vice chairman of the oversight investigations subcommittee i been involved in hearings we have had a two this point on this important subject and i'm glad to see us finally getting to the point of considering legislation critical to the health and safety of americans. in throughout this we have seen examples of both good and bad actors in the food industry, some companies like massaleit,   u.s.a. said is dinner with pride to food safety audits and showed us what can happen when companies do the right thing and reaching out and doing their own investigations. on the other hand, we heard extensively about pca and as unsanitary conditions and about its actions to misrepresent the results of audits that are then which put people at risk and cost people lives. that's why we're here to talk about what we can do to improve the current state of thesituation. this food safety and has an actual end -- so many limitations and i'm glad and requires increase inspections of facilities the material inspection systems that distinguish between high-risk facilities, low-risk and warehouses, and i also support the provisions to ensure the safety of imported foods which is something i have fought for since introduction of the fresh produce safety act. also there imports may i am proud that this bill has strong   whistle-blower protections and i believe that it will help keep america's food supply safer. many might consider some of the provisions in this bill byrne and some however it's important to look at the opportunity cost of dealing to take action to improve food safety and our march 19 oversight hearing i asked david mackie the ceo of kellogg how much the pca salmonella outbreak had cost his company and he replied between 65 and $70 million. the legislation before us todaymight have prevented the outbreak is saved those costs. most important however is what we owe to the families of this country who have been injured or killed by unsafe foods and the desire to take real action to keep our food supply safer. in 2006 and a graduate of duke waller high-school in my district a marathon runner named jill: contracted he coli from a spinach salad g8. after 17 days in the hospital she was released with a percent of her kidney function and she   now has to see a doctor twice a year to monitor her kidneys. jill and all other americans should be able to have faith in their food and we are here today to try to restore that they. to thank you mr. chairman. >> thank you. the gentleman from maryland, mr. sarbanes. >> thank you mr. chairman and well, dr. hamburg, we are so excited to see you in this position and we look for tier teon","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 5, 2009 11:30am-12:00pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

>> across the board, the view of our plans was that it was not aggressive enough. >> how much money are you going to save when the dust settles and i guess these people are forced out of business and a whole bunch of people like them? tell me on your books how much money you will book as a savings. >> this is an area as i said before, it's about $1,000 per car of total distribution costs.   we need to work that down over time. you can't -- there's no way you can point to one individual dealer. it can't be done that way. you have to look at it and say if you can take -- if you have $1,000 per car, you can over time economize that to $900 per car. that's a lot of money in our case. finally, this is all about actually then attracting capital to the dealer body over time. >> did you do any cost analysis where you looked at the jobs lost, the pain caused, the impact on local communities, andsaid boy, dollars and cents, we win on this one. >> i think gm's brands win with the right -- >> no. not asking that. just asking did you do a cost benefit and analysis, an economic analysis of any kind? is there something you can send to me where i can go back to these people and say you know, gm looked at this, they're going to save x dollars? >> individual location by location, no. >> chrysler, did you do that?   >> we did not go by location. we have it for the total and the new companies dealer network. >> what's the total? how much is chrysler going to save by shutting down all these dealerships? >> we are going to save approximately $1.4 billion in development costs, $200 -- per year, $200 million per year in marketing and advertising costs and about $1.5 billion of additional revenue from the substandard market shared dealer representation and about i thinkit's around $41,000 per dealer affected in terms of cost of actually going out and calling on the dealer and having people come and make records and do all of that support. >> would you be willing to supply that document to the committee? >> sir, it's included in the written testimony that i submitted. >> okay. let me ask a question about kind of the net effect of what you guys are all about. if i had a share of chrysler or   general motors stock today, what's its value? >> its value today for general motors would be almost zero. >> chrysler? >> also, we have no net worth. we're out of business at this time. >> and how many shareholders did chrysler have? >> two. >> and how many shareholders did general motors have? >> we had 550 million shares outstanding so thousands and thousands of shareholders.>> they're just out today? >> yes. >> okay. these dealers, what's their dealership worth without the brand and maybe somebody from the dealership can give me that. >> practically zero. >> practically zero. >> senator, the value of their business would be the franchise value and the real estate, essentially, real estate has been seriously devalued because these are single purpose buildings that will not be reoccupied and the value of the franchise are what we call good will or blue sky is virtually   gone. >> let me ask chrysler and gm, what's the value of the bonds today? the indebtedness? is it ten cents on the dollar, 15 cents on the dollar, five cents on the dollar? >> in the caves our bonds, they have generally traded less than 20 cents on the dollar. in some case less than 10 cents on the dollar. >> chrysler? >> we have no bond. the equity holders will receive approximately 29 cents on the dollar. >> 29 cents on the dollar.okay. here's my question. shareholders basically out of luck. bond holders, pennies on the dollar. dealers, not doing any better. i could go on and on. does it occur to you that in this process, as you were putting this together with the very large investment of tax payer dollars, in chrysler's case, that would be how much?   >> well, we have received $3 million and $4 million for debt financing so far. there will be additional funds coming for the outlaying company. >> don't you think there was some justification for congressional oversight here? >> from our standpoint, the reality is our relationship with treasury has been one of -- as being a bank, being an investorin our company. they have been excellent to work with in terms of assisting us as an equity fund would, and the funds have really been invested in a way that the taxpayers' interests have been looked at very carefully. >> you side-stepped my question. go ahead. >> in our case, it's $50 billion is what we expect to receive in total from the u.s. taxpayer, number one. number two, our primary relationship has been with the automotive task force. number three, as i said in my opening remarks, our commitment to remain very transparent because we need to be, not only   because we're a company in bankruptcy but because the u.s. taxpayer is our largest shareholder. >> thank you for your indulgence. >> senator begich? >> thank you very much, mr. chairman. mr. mceleney, can i ask you a question first just so i understand? of the gm and chrysler dealerships, what percentage does your association represent? >> 50 -- >> 92% -- excuse me. senator, we represent about 92% of the dealers of all brands,both domestic and international. >> to -- thank you very much for that. i just want to make sure i was clear on the stats. to the two gentlemen from chrysler and general motors, did you ever have any inclination as you developed, i will turn to both in regards to the documents that are required by dealers to sign, did you ever have any inclination to work with the association to figure out what's a decent agreement that the dealerships could sign? >> let me see if i can't deal   with both of the agreements. in the case of the wind-down agreement, as i said, we had done a similar exercise in canada just recently and our early returns from our dealers who are going to be wound down and with the appeal process, we think we have a workable approach for those dealers. >> if i can interrupt, it's kind of a no choice deal. >> it is, but in our judgment, the benefits that are provided in this agreement are vastly superior to the alternatives. >> which is death versus life support? >> the alternative is -- well, no, sir. in this case, what we're goingto provide them is the ability to wind down their franchise through october of next year. so they have plenty of ability to take care of customers and we provide compensation to them. >> let me ask you that on october of next year, is that still the same status in the bankruptcy process you are going through today, you will continue to uphold that to 2010, october? >> in the case of a dealer that chooses not to sign the wind-down agreement, they won't have a contractual relationship with the new general motors. >> so no to that? >> the old general motors would reject their contract. >> senator, can i --   >> if i can get from chrysler, then i will come back. >> we do not have an agreement specifically. what we did for our process, for redistribution and for the dealer soft landing is we worked with our dealer counsel, we worked with a group of other dealers within the company that were intimately familiar with our situation, and we were able to achieve good input and we then applied it. >> let me, if i can, if i can hold the dealers just for a second, i have to watch my timebut i want to get a couple quick questions in here. with regard to the dealers as i asked my opening questions, there is four components, from my understanding. i can only tell you this as a former mayor. they are large property owners. large property owners. so you take care of to some degree their inventory, parts, tools, but what happens to the investment on their building as well as their lots which basically come very obsolete   facilities. i was also 25 years in the real estate business. these are properties that in today's market are going to be very hard for them and that's a big size amount of their long term investment. do you have any compensation or opportunities for them in that regard? mitigation in any of that front? from either one of you. it's a simple yes or no. it's not a complicated question. >> it's a bankruptcy. we have none. >> none. okay. gm? >> yes, we do. >> you have some compensation,mitigation for investment they have in their land or building? >> eight months of rent support in their wind-down agreement. >> rent support. okay. let me turn to the dealers. you wanted to respond very quickly to either one of you. >> yes. i want to tell you a small dealership like us, we pay anywhere between $1200 to $2300 a month to chrysler and gm for software to order our parts. we rent signs, i rent signs that are 30 years old that put new faces on them but like $620 a month.   you as a consumer, when you buy that car, it's on the maroney label to be delivered to us. it doesn't cost them one thing to send us a car. we pay for the advertising. we pay for even the pamphlets that you come in our dealership showroom and take. >> i understand that. >> okay. we pay for all that. we do not cost them one penny. >> let me go -->> i just wanted to address the vehicle redistribution plan one more time. last week i sent an e-mail to the southwest business center specifically asking for a definite timeline on redistribution. what am i supposed to be doing, what is my plan. the response back was possibly we'll try to have a plan by next week. next week is the last week. we're out of time. >> let me ask, again, i will run out of time here, i can feel it. in the time lines that have been granted, the june 12th timeline,   if i get that right, is there any opportunity to expand that? yes or no? >> in our case, senator, no. >> in the parts of the appeal process that they have before june 9th or 12th, whatever that date is on the appeal process, is there any opportunity to extend that beyond the target date of when they have to sign? >> no. >> mr. chairman, i have plenty of questions and i know i haveto go to another meeting. but i guess two documents i would like to have, if they can present them to us. one is i think senator johanns asked the question and that is in regards to your actual savings that you will achieve and chrysler laid that out in detail. i just looked through your testimony. it's kind of scattered through there. i would like a document that actually shows that. the same thing to gm. i recognize your issue about $1,000 a car. i want to know what you have calculated into the cost factor.   the second thing is mr. henderson, you mentioned or both you did, actually, kind of aprocess you went through to determine dealerships and some criteria you used. you made a comment we don't have necessarily a list. you have to have a list. you have to. you just can't say dealer a, dealer b. so i would like, if you can answer this yes or no that you can provide this, a list of how or list of the dealers in order of ranking that you made in order to determine who was there at the end of the day and whowill not be there. if you say you don't have a list, i will not believe that. there's no way you could do this without a list. >> senator, we have a list but have not made it available to anybody because our dealers would prefer to not be identified as to which ones are winding down versus -- >> well, they are going to be identified. >> they don't want to know today. >> mr. chairman, i would just like to see it. i will leave it to the chairman of what the appropriate way to get that, but i think it's important for us to understand because that seems to be some great conflict here.   and how you created the list and who is on the top and who's not. i think it's fair because reality, they're all going to know sooner or later. we're all going to know and we will come back and ask you again. >> the senator has made a request for three sets of documents. i happen to agree with him. i think they should be produced for this committee. i ask you, mr. press, mr. henderson, if they will so do. >> yes. >> yes, sir. >> thank you.senator lautenberg? >> mr. henderson, you used the term soft landing. in the short form, would you describe what the soft landing is? >> yes, senator. if the dealer signs the wind-down agreement, they will have until october of 2010 to wind down their inventory so they'll have over 12 months to wind down their inventory, wind   down their parts inventory, transition perhaps to another franchise. they will be able to use the gm auction so they can buy used cars and they get compensation in part up front and in part at the end for rent support and invento inventory. >> forgive me, but soft landing ultimately is like a parachute with holes in it, maybe it will slow down the trip but the end is going to be terrible.that's a conclusion one has to come to because as people react to the prospect of@@@@@@@@ b@ rr   things going but the end is clearly in sight and i think people are going to defer to the time when they're going to have to say to their families look,we don't have the income anymore, we don't have the employees, would you expect the employees would hang around until the last day that they can continue working or you think they might look for something else and get out while the getting's good? >> senator, one of the reasons why, with all due respect, we will supply it, we have not been public with the list of the dealers who agreed to the wind-down agreement is because we give them 12 to 16 months to determine what they would like to do with their business without having that hanging over them, sir.   >> mr. press, you apparently said to the dealers either help us or burn us all down. would having the availability of some degree of financing, do you think it would be a good idea for the company to take back the inventory that's out there in dealer hands?>> yes, that's why we developed the redistribution process so we could accomplish that, sir. >> but you're saying now you don't have the means with which to accomplish that? >> we are. we are 97% complete in the redistribution of product and we will be done before -- by the june 9th deadline. >> mr. henderson, general motors has announced plans to eliminate 1100 dealers under franchise laws in my state of new jersey   and other states. the companies must compensate dealers and take back unsold inventory of the franchise. while the bankruptcy proceeding may remove the legal obligation to purchase this inventory, is there more of an obligation beside following the legal line for your company to take back the remaining inventory from dealers?because you talk about when foreign car competition was coming around and it's too bad why the gm leadership at the time didn't see the handwriting on the wall. but is there, again, something beyond the legal obligation to step in and take back the remaining inventory? >> sir, as i said, if a dealer signs the wind-down agreement, they will no question be able to wind down the inventory over   that period of time. if they don't wish to sign the agreement, if they floor plan their vehicles or get their wholesale financing with gmac today, they have the right to voluntarily terminate their agreement, return the vehicles to gmac and it's our responsibility to redistribute the vehicles with gmac, a responsibility that was confirmed on monday through the bankruptcy court. >> when i ask either of you, mr. press, mr. henderson, the industry fell behind as overseas companies developed vehicles that were more fuel efficientthan those made in detroit. oil prices inevitably rose, you were stuck with trucks and suvs that few people wanted, and now president obama has proposed strict new efficiency standards. how can you assure us with a degree of reasonableness that you will be able to make these more fuel efficient cars and trucks to help your companies return to profitability when all   of these years, there was no credibility given to your assessment of the marketplace or your engineering to beat the competition? >> senator, in our history, we have never missed a cafe standard or fuel economy standard in the u.s. or -- >> i don't know what kind of fight there was here about cafe standards. >> i understand. secondly, just recently as part of the industry, we threw our weight fully behind harmonizing more aggressive, more stringent fuel economy standards. not only gm but the industrypulled together and we're quite confident the men and women of general motors will deliver vehicles will meet all those standards and excite customers. >> i'm sure the men and women will deliver what's put out there. but the leadership showed that it didn't understand what it was going to take to be competitive. mr. press, you want to comment? >> yes, senator. in our situation, our new company has an alliance with fiat and fiat will be the operating entity within the company. they have the highest -- the   best performance of all european manufacturers in co2. their technology is all available to us. we are already at work to adopt that technology, to build it in american plants, and in fact, the equity incentives that they have are based on the introduction of very high mileage technology engines and products in u.s. plants. >> lord help us. thank you very much. >> mr. chairman, thank you verymuch. the one disagreement that i have heard here among others is that the auto manufacturers have responded to the dealers by suggesting that the dealers are a cost center or implying that the dealers are a burden. the dealers have said quite the opposite. to quite the contrary. it seems to me to the automobile manufacturers you don't have a business without dealers. you can manufacture but if you don't sell them, you're out of business. so the dealers it seems to me are an asset.   i was looking at the statement on page five, mr. press. you talked about examples of lost revenue and cost associated with in this case, discontinued dealers but i assume you would associate them with the continued dealers as well. the overwhelming costs are not costs that are local to mr. lopez or mr. whatley. product engineering and development for sister vehicles, $1.4 billion over four years. those are decisions you made, not the dealers.the decision to build a town and country and the dodge version of that, have both of them, that's your decision, not their decision. but lost sales due to dealer underperformance, $1.5 billion annually. someone asked a couple questions on cost burden and so on, but you are eliminating dealers. waco, texas, my colleague says you will eliminate the crieser dealerships in waco, texas. are you going to replace them with new dealers? another question for both general motors and cries   already. chrysler. how many are in a position where you will just eliminate the local dealership and replace them with other dealers because you felt the local dealer was underperforming? can you provide us a number? >> first of all, with regard to the multiple sister platforms, we had to do six of those and they are not our request. it's because we have stand-alone dealers. if there's a jeep or a dodgestand-alone only dealer and we don't do a dodge version of the van, then they can't be supported. we have stopped making those and the dealer body stand-alone is not viable any longer. that's the reason for it in the cost. the answer is we can provide you with a list. it's not a large number of those points that we are going to be going back into, but i can give you that number. >> would each of the companies provide us with the number of the dealerships that you are going to close and that you will then replace because you felt the current dealerships were   underperforming? i want to ask mr. lopez and mr. whatley. you heard the manufacturers suggest you're a burden and a cost center. you say you are not. >> yes, sir. >> they say they advertise for you, they -- >> i have brought dealer billing statements for the last couple of months showing everything that we pay and it's everything from paper clips to signs to training, a whole lot of things. i don't even know what they are. we just pay it every month. >> they send somebody around every now and then to check up on you? >> it's electronic billingstatements. we are billed every month. >> they take it out automatically. you have no choice. >> you come in one day and your account will be less $6,000 for parts of a vehicle that you have to work on. >> i understand you' are leasin their signs and doing those things. they send the regional or local rep around -- >> we don't have one. >> i don't know who our rep is anymore. we haven't seen one in so long. >> that's not so expensive, is it? >> no. >> we don't have one. they call us on the phone.   >> we're billed for everything. >> by the way, i paid $480 for my -- and chrysler's in bankruptcy, paid $480 this month so my certified mechanics could take a test on the computer. $480. >> senator, i just got a bill yesterday for $200 for sales training for next month when i'm not even a dealer. >> all right. well, some things are counter intuitive to me. i understand that you want tochange your dealership network, that's your responsibility, not the government's. i understand all that. yet i mean, i don't know much about big cities. that's not what i know much about. but i know areas out there where somebody's selling five, eight cars a month. a good small business that some would probably say from up high, too small to matter. but a business in the community that's making a little money, doing some service, brand loyalty on their customers. in my hometown, you got people   that stopped at the regional garage, they would only buy chevrolet for the rest of their lives. that's just, they wouldn't stop anywhere else. when it was time for a car, they go back to the chevy. time for a tractor, they go back for the case. never think about buying a john deere. the same was true on the other side with other dealerships in small towns. what i don't understand is if the local dealers are not a burden and it seems to me in this back and forth, boy, they're not much of a burden to you at all. it seems to me they represent the ability to sell what you manufacture, even the smallerones. it's just counter intuitive that you would decide you know what,g to limit the ability to sell out there by reducing the number of people that are going to sell. just, you know, i got, went through masters degree in business and so on. they never taught that. it seems to me that you would want to maximize the opportunity to tinseling a product that has been piling up on the lots. >> may i make one more comment in. >> yes. >> excuse me. if -- say we stock about 65 new   cars. the dealer next to me is 30 miles away, he's completely full. he's already stocking everything he can stock. he's up on his floor plan, he's full. by eliminating me, that other dealer is not going to order one extra vehicle. he doesn't frankly care good i'm there or not. he's already doing all he can do. they just lost my 65 cars in production. 800 dealers, how much production are they losing? >> mr. lopez? >> well, i wanted to respond to what he said about the -- as faras the cars that they made us take. they are sitting there -- he says 97% that is taken care of. no one has called me. i haven't heard a thing. at that time, i had 41 cars. now i'm down to 24. and i'm selling them and i'm not going to take a loss, i can't afford to. i'm a small dealer. i'm selling them at net and i will do that, no one called me and said can we help you, can we send them to another dealership?   we did it on our own. >> we have seen nothing. >> and also, i wanted to tell you, when you talked about the representative, there is no representative from chrysler or gm. it is all done by phone, by computer. how about our inventory that we have in stock? i have $138,000 worth of parts from chrysler and 128 in generalmotors. they're going to be worth nothing, not one penny. how can they say we cost them? we don't cost them a penny. in fact, we are their face. we are out there. we -- and, you know, in our community, i sell cars and i'm delighted to represent them. i want one thing -- one question answered, if they do take our franchise, can they -- will   they -- can they and will they give us first option if they decide to open up in that area again? we as a dealer. i am a profitable dealer. i have never been reprimanded. got awards. if they decide two years now to put a chrysler dealership in spencer, west virginia, can it be me? why won't it be me? >> mr. chairman, my time -- i've taken more than enough, but i appreciate the testimony and ithink we would very much like to get some reports back from you about your inventory, parts inventory, auto inventory, how it is dealt with. >> thank you, senator. senator snowe? >> thank you, mr. chairman. mr. henderson and mr. press, in response to, i think it was senator johanns question about economic analysis, mr. henderson, did you say you did   not perform any economic analysis on dealer by dealer in making these decisions? did either of you perform an economic analysis using specific criteria by cwhich you made thee decisions in targeting these dealers. >> the criteria was sales effectiveness so the dealers that were notified for wind down have been consistently underperforming in terms of sales effectiveness. we have","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 5, 2009 3:00am-3:30am EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

>> i think it is going to been depending on the state. i think that the overwhelming majority of states will probably do what they would normally do in this type of recessionary time which is to the extent they can turn to bond financing. i think there are a handful, frankly the larger of is the california, that will still utilize bond financing but ithink they have their own very difficult issues that they have to deal with to ensure that they can continue, but we have never seen a state the faults. usada some transportation in the '30's but states are still exceptionally low risk 96 out -- good investments i think investors realize that and i don't expect that to be an issue. >> anything else in the room?   >> if you look at and i appreciate the percentage of tom% of the budgets here, if you look back into the 80s and the seven days as a percent of the budgets, is this on a scale you haven't seen or is it similar to the state budgets smaller then? >> i would say and then i thinkwe don't have statistics back to the 30's but i thank you really got to go back there. i think this is the worst thing we have seen. most people and we initially it this downturn a body would be similar to 83. from one i have seen again we were down 83, but the year before and a year after we have very good revenue and we were down and back very quickly. and this started december 2008   so we are into this a while. we have to do three more years ago so i think it is related deaths and the length of this. there is no capability to sort of bill the revenue base, built the rainy day funds generally on the defense of the entire time. >> [inaudible] -- and the blackthis tussle to be a very long and deep downturn? >> no, i haven't heard of any states discussing that, i think they -- i think they will all is to do that frankly partly because of bond rating issues, but i think it is really the choices are dealing on the expenditure sign in the revenue side tax systems and so forthwith.   >> when you talk about the number of states, 24 states i think that are going to be increasing taxes, that was that -- was that billion or a million? >> adel a member the exact number of states. is 24 million ha but 25 the 30 states i think are in that. >> we will check back for you. >> okay, what we go to the phone operator, are there anyquestions on the fan? >> thank you, i have a question, and there are any questions press star and then one on your touch-tone phone. we have a question from frank wolf from education daily, please go ahead. >> i wondered if you could discuss education funding by the states were in a little bit, one impact we are seen and what they can do to sort of protect   programs? >> well, they were beginning to do some cuts in education and then when the recovery package came i think they sort of backed off a somewhat. governors generally like to protected, but on for some lovely going forward is going to be hard to continue to protect them in spite of a recovery package binding because it is such a significant portion and,in other words, if you look at health care and education you have 70 percent of your total budget and i think so far when they have done is they have cut the rest of that, but now i think going forward and, of course, they're probably going to have to look more both at hiring secondary and elementary. >> write thank-you. >> our next question is from kevin from associated press, please go ahead.   >> given the economic environment and should the federal government consider guaranteeing short-term loans and bond issues from the state's? >> i will let you take that. [laughter] >> well, we certainly don't have a position on that, and that does seem to be an issue with the states vary in their positions on that, just depending on their current ability or at least they'reperceived ability to go out in the markets. i do think though that while there was a lot of consternation at the beginning of this financial crisis last fall is interesting to see that again i think there is a realization that despite the turmoil and a difficult fiscal situation from my financing side, again the states compared to other entities are very low risk and even in california frankly very low rest both historically and otherwise and i think over time   and that will be realized he mack the only other thing i would say is it is not easy, as i remember the federal reserve really can't do that legally. i thank you need congress to act to provide the right and i would just say in the average and in terms of broadly congress is not pushing it forward. >> our next question, please goahead and. >> [inaudible] >> our next question is from lisa jann from abc news. >> thanks, my question has to do with the recovery act and the state's fiscal spending with respect to which you talked a little bit about now even with the recovery act the decline has gone up, i think a little bit   more about how the recovery act impacted in medicaid and education, where we're seeing specifically how that has helped? >> okay, as i mentioned, those two programs represent about 135 billion. is the only flexible money that is their. and what is allows states to do particularly in the medicaid because it is also the medicaid money retroactive to october asi remember 2008 and is over 27 months the number that has out states to take their money because the fed was picking up an extra 6% share and to spread it around and factual find places where that money was even used to protect education. from a macro economic standpoint it was very positive because we   have shortfalls of 200 billion going into the downturn before the recovery package and that would have had a larger negative impact, so the medicaid money in the education money really you can see it as soon as it was the bill was going to go through. and number of states have are the announced cuts were able to put them on hold. the problem is that we always figured it would be nice to get30 to 50 percent of the shortfall and a particular time and that is what it pinned down to me, but the economy deteriorated so much more after that that there is just not enough flexible money. so i think it was a very very good policy, it was a fair amount of flexible money and it was highly targeted. basically the two areas that governors wanted to protect, so i'm very positive about the recovery package, but this downturn is just much worse than   anyone anticipated. >> if i could just follow up, have states anecdotally said anything to you about the multiplier affected how the hope that impacts their revenues in terms of some of the targeted non flexible spending that is supposed to go on in their states'? >> well, there is a multiplier a fight on all of the stimulus and unfortunately in a lot of the other is going to be much later. and other words the highway money will pay out over to thethree years and the money of from water and so on and so it will create a multiplier, but unfortunately it will be significantly later. >> the recovery package i think did a good job because most of the tax cuts were very fine and in. the flexible money to states was front and it but a lot of the construction money was further down, but is pretty positive from the standpoint that it really did help over a to a   three-year time. >> thank you. >> next question is from stephen from state line.org, please go ahead and. >> this is a question for both of you. they usually the lifetime for states to catch up to the retiree is about two years. are you saying today from york, some with that you think it might be three, four or five years this time?>> scott, do you want to take that? >> i think it could and i think what
         
          they're telling us right now and certainly when we look at this report what we say is if you do have the recession and this year or by the end of this year, we hope that at least by fiscal year 11 usc but does come close to 2008 levels and then we would see growth budgets in 2012, but the severity in   length of this recession continues then it could go further. but as ray and others have said to, the problem is that we have some real difficult structural issues going for and just in terms of all kinds of a cause drivers like correction costs for prisons and so the question is as the recovery money and is, how much is made up my increase in revenue from an improved economy? so i thank you said -- could seedepending on the state airline in terms of growth rates for budgets not until fiscal year 2012 came and the only other comment i would make is if the unemployment begins to come down then you can soon -- assume state revenues will begin to, but the big problem here is the medicaid growth is going to be very late in the cycle and if you don't get a fairly strong   uptick that growth is really going to be a huge problem for several years to come. >> i just want to add another reminder because it is all born from the revenue side is that most days particularly those with personal income taxes are extremely dependent on the wealthiest individuals for basically that capital gains in investment income so really what happens with and source of revenue of the next two to five years really is going to have a huge impact on the fiscal situation in the state's.>> any other questions, operator? >> we have a question from john coffee from the commercial, please go ahead. john, your line is open, go ahead with your question.   >> the know how many state legislatures and governors are late or deadlocked in passing the budget for the next fiscal year because of financial problems and disagreements? >> we don't have a number right now. i think that question will be particularly apropos and about three weeks because it will be interesting to see how many finish up. i think there are states concerned the right now i would only be a handful of anywherefrom five or 10. >> you can imagine three wakes is an eternity in terms of the legislatures and governors trying to fix budgets. >> next question is from tanning from cnn the money, please go ahead. >> to think that calendars are getting a battle abashed gunners   are getting a better handle on the budgets for 2010 who are going to be more i don't use a realistic for accurate or will we see continued year scramble to close the gaps? >> i personally don't, i name, until the rate of decline really begins to bottom out, in terms of the state revenue numbers, it's going to be very difficult.one of the hardest problems and economic forecasting is to the turning points and it is very difficult, so once you begin now to see that on a main and then i think the accuracy will decrease quite dramatically but until lead time i think there's going to be a lot of unknowns. >> i have to say that is what is so remarkable about this because the fiscal folks, i can tell you how much they can wait for the day when the have civility between the amount of money   coming in and their forecasts and the continue to believe that they have rammed their forecasts as far down as possible and there still missing and so it is remarkable as to how difficult this recession has been promised standpoint of state revenues. >> the only other thing i mentioned is everybody was looking for so-called green shoots and today there are now questioning whether the green shoots are really they're so we've got to have the shootsfirst before we talk at all about revenue. >> thank you. >> next question is from chris buckley, please go ahead. >> a quick question about the program cuts. you talked about in 2009 we have the chart that showed that higher education and k. 312 and   a heisman of cuts in terms of the most states making cuts, do you have numbers in terms of dollar figures that show which areas by a dollar figure out the biggest cuts across all states? >> we did not specifically asked that in this report, we just asked if they did a particular cut to that area in that particular topic area. >> do you know generally the education sectors when compared to other areas? in terms of dollars generally.>> my guess is and from what we have heard is you primarily will see that in the higher education area to the extent it was k-12 and a lot has been made up by the recovery act funds and, of course, there are requirements not to allow for further declines based on previous levels, so to the extent to see that it would be primarily concerned higher education areas but again there are maintenance of effort requirements for   higher education also so my guess is the percentage would be very low although you did see cuts in those areas. >> thank you. >> we have a question from frankel from education daily, please go ahead and. >> i just wanted to make sure these are estimated fiscal year 2009, 2.2% decline in state spending is projected. i guess most days and there yearwhether may or jann? >> yes, 46 states at the end of this month on june 30th so you are correct, those are estimates and when we do the fiscal report in december we will have actuals. >> great, thanks. >> at this time we have no further questions. >> okay, thank you very much, we appreciate it.   >> think use ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call, you may disconnect at this time. [inaudible conversations]our party needs a lot of work. >> sunday on c-span2 and a coming indiana republican governor mitch daniels on revitalizing the gop. the maquis think looking in ridley and think about how it can speak more meaningfully tothe problems of today and to the americans of today, the young people of today specifically. maybe i can be a part of that we don't have to be a candidate to do that. >> q&a with governor mitch daniels sunday night on c-span, also on xm radio or download this c-span podcast >> earlier this week fbi director robert mueller talk about the fbi's role infighting financial crime including crimes   and haven't happened yet as funds are being distributed. held by the economic club of new york this lasts about 40 minutes.

[speaking foreign language][speaking foreign language] >> as i sit here 20 years   later, living exile with a little hope of ever returning to china. i feel compelled to remind people of the brutality showed by the leadership then in control of china. mainly shao ping. as most of us believe it was his sole decision. and i am compelled in thisdemocracy movement and behalf of those living in china today, to call on the current chinese government to bring freedom to our home land. and to have the courage not to be held captive of the actions held of the predecessors on june 4, 1989. [repeating in chinese]   [repeating in chinese]>> that night the chinese government sent massive soldiers and tanks into the   square to crush our peaceful demonstration and any hope to consider our request for economic and political reform lead by students. we should be there for 50 days of calm protests and hunger strikes, like in 1976 when thepolice came in and beat the leaders. we never expected a massacre, beijing city was outraged and the world shocked.

[repeating in chinese]>> the shooting started around 10 p.m., and by 2 a.m. we were surrounded by the army. two to three thousand workers and students were killed. many more were injured like ourdear friend today. we held one last vote and decided to leave the square. by a latest agreement to close the government. [repeating in chinese]   [repeating in chinese]>> each of our survival stories are different. two-thirds of the students were captured and served jail terms. others escaped from china and hiding into western countries. despite being number one on the   list, i was fortunate to hide in china and escape 10 months after. with the help of over 200 members of underground rescue groups and eventually came to the united states. [repeating in chinese][repeating in chinese]   >> today those of us who have lived and experienced the freedom and now appeal to the leaders of china to do the following things. [repeating in chinese] >> it has been 20 years, the current leadership bears no responsible for the tiananmen massacre. to acknowledge the massacre andbegin a dialogue for those who have suffered. to release the prisoners from june 4, 1989. to create a black list of those still in effect, and to have a truthful history of the massacre. the first request is that -- [repeating in chinese. ]   [repeating in chinese] >> to revisit the highlights of reform, to study of taiwan andsouth africa and other countries. it's clear that the reform doesn't have to lead the chaos of civil war. but to start with the press and free elections and opposition parties.

and stood for five days before destroyed by a   tank, 20 years ago today. and that to gather those who were in tiananmen square, and countless other chinese citizens who had risen in protest in over 370 chinese cities across the country. from the northwest to the deep south. and it's since become a universal symbol of democracy.which is why we have given it as our democracy award since 1991 to brave people in all regions of the world who are fighting for democracy. as you all know, there are some people today who think that the united states and other countries shouldn't be pressing china is issues of democracy and human rights.   do they think there are more important things to talk about china, or that the chinese people and their view are somehow unfit for democracy and require a dictator. so the chinese government today is codled and appeased that there are some chinese democrats who feel forgottenand abandoned. but they should not be discouraged than others and the right to think that democracy in china is not important or realistic. and for the same reason, what is overlooked by the disheartened democrats and the so-called realists. is the extreme vulnerability of the chinese system of government. certainly the chinese   government feels vulnerable. if one is to judge by its behavior. otherwise why which -- why would it go to great lengths to erase the tiananmen uprising and crack down. indeed it's removed any mention of this event in textbooks or media. and arrests journalists who attempt to write about theevent or anyone who would speak to such journalists. it has blocked web casts. just yesterday the government sent block access to twitter and on youtube, all to shield the population from any hint of today's anniversary.   when ju dian died four years ago, the city took caution after remembering how the death in 1989 sparked the uprising. it's declared extreme sensitivity, put alarmed policeon special alert. these are not the actions of a regime that feels secure. on the contrary, they are the actions of a regime that thinks it's sitting on top of a volcano that's about to erupt . or the center of an earthquake, hazord zone. the reason for this insecurity was spelled out in a lecture in   beijing by a nationally known scholarists. the chinese system he explaned by strict rigidity. where there is no rule of law to protect people's interest orprevent the rulers from abusing the people and lining their own pockets. the dominance feature in a governance of this abilities and the issues of people's legitimate issues, homeowner rights for urban residents and minority rights, that all of   this becomes a threat to the social order. a rigid system is by definition bristled. it lacks resiliance, it can break under stress. and there are many sources of stress in china today. people have grievances because their rights are denied and they have no resource to --recourse. to the authorities that are offensive. and they are angered by those things beyond their interest, such as massive corruption and degradation. given the widespread of the internet in china today, and the fact that half the population has mobile phones. citizens are more aware of their rights than ever before   and more connected to each other. and as observed, the regime has lost its only source of legitimacy. which he said was the revolution. in his words, revolutionary discourse has distanced itself from us. revolution is no longer legitimate. the only source of reallegitimacy, what he calls resilient, is democracy in the framework of a constitution. in a system where the government is in constant dialogue with the society, through elections and the independent media. where the authority comes from the people and is subject to constant review. where conflicts are resolved   lawfully and people are treated fairly. such a system will not break apart, because it's able to bend. it's not threatened by sparks. because it's made of the inflammable material of law. democracy and respect for rights. such resilience stability and democracy is the only way thatchina can escape from what we calls the tragic fate of two millennia of the cycle of chaos and order. >> you are watching public affairs programming on c-span. coming up next, the housing budget committee for the operations units.   and after that president obama's

[laughter] i had to edit that for the paper to make that sound less incendiary but it was very memorable. >> thank you so much for sharing and we hope to hear more from you as the program goes on. today we are going to be talking with bob schieffer and gettinghis take on politics and the media. we might ask him about our ten entertainment saying is he is both. he served as chief washington correspondent and pose the face the nation. he has covered washington for a cbs news for 40 years. bob has written four books about his career in journalism. his most recent is bob schieffer's america. please join me in welcoming bob schieffer. [applause]   before we talk with bob and our students our associate producer, daniel panetta at students about their perception of the news business. >> hi frank, this is daniel. i am at the digital news exhibit where we are asking highschool students, is the state of the news business getting better or worse? here is what they had to say. >> i think some news channels are becoming more biased in certain directions at differenttimes and when i am watching the news, on line or auntie via i'd like to switch channels and a lot so i will have a good mix of liberal, conservative whatever. >> even with the rise in the popularity with the internet being used for news i still believe the tv is strong and becoming stronger because people will still want that personal touch and the thought of having that person in their home telling them what is going on in the world will always remain a big thing.   >> there you have it frank. back to you in the studio. >> thank you dannette. the state of broadcast journalism in the 21st century. bob, one of the students had a nerve there. so many outlets now. aidid no longer the big screen networks carving the pauline 2/3. what kinds of pressures does that exert on broadcasting? >> well, i think those of us in the mainstream media see our world as being the place where people can come where perhaps they have one point of view oranother point of view but we are the place we hope where people can agree on the facts. and accurate summation of what the news actually is and from that, all of the analysis, all the commentary grows. i thought one of the students had on a very good point. there are so many of points of you out there on radio, on television, on the internet that the question then every time i have addressed an audience   somebody brings up the question, is the media bias? it has almost become an irrelevant question because there are so many points of view out there. we are almost that as it was during the time of lincoln when there was no such thing as subjectivity, when you have liberal papers, republican papers, everybody had a point of view. nobody expected an objective view. the whole idea of objectivity is a fairly new one. i thought the other student inthat interview made a very good point. he said, i like to switch around. that is what an informed person has to do and should do now. you should not depend on one source for news. get a variety of sources and then come to your conclusions. >> you had a recent interview with former vice president dick cheney that made news, particularly on his assertion that talk-show host rush limbaugh was the better republican and former secretary   of state colin powell. your reaction to the response of that exchange. >> well, it was an amazing response and when i give lectures to journalism classes, i always say the greatest mistake that young reporters make is, they assume they know what somebody is going to answer when they ask them a question and a lot of times they won't ask the question because they say, i know what he is going to say. i don't need to ask that question.that is a reporters worst enemy, assumption. you never assumed. i would not in my wildest dreams have imagined that former vice president cheney would say that he would pick rush limbaugh over colin powell when it came to republicans, but that is what he said and that is where the news was. so, you know i always tell young reporters, there are no bad questions. there are just that answers. a lot of young reporters assume,   they feel like well if i ask that question they will think i'm dumb because they think i should know the answer. reporters are there to ask the other person in question, not to give their views, so don't be afraid to ask the question. asked the obvious questions first. every once in awhile he will get lucky like that and as a result of that comment, people wrote and follow the up for literally two weeks and then when i had colin powell on the broadcast two weeks later to see what hethought about that, we had another two weeks of information. it was a very important story though because what it was, it was the story about the soul of the republican party, where is the republican party, what does it want to be and where is it going to be? that is really what that was all about so i was very proud of that. >> let's go to a student right away. welcome to close-up at the newseum. >> my name is sarah. i am from nebraska. my question is what issue news   media concerns to the most? >> right now is how are newspapers going to find some sort of a business model to allow them to continue to exist? it is very expensive to plant and operate a newspaper. bill keller, who was the editor of ""the new york times"" told me that, when the iraq war was at its height to the times were spending $2 million a year just for the security to keep its baghdad bureau opened and to beable to report the news. at one point during the war the times had 100 reporters in iraq. one blogger, one blogger is not going to be able to go to our bracken spend that kind of money, and nor can one blogger b of the kind of information coming at that bureau. >> whether papers are printed on paper or whether we are going to read them on the internet is almost beside the point.   if it is going to be on the internet, as yet, no news organization has found out how you can develop a business model where you can make enough money off of display ads on the internet to support the kind of news organization that it takes to do what our mainstream papers are doing now, so that is the problem that i think. the problem, there are problems with the journalism at the mainproblem for newspapers today and also for television stations to a certain extent is not the journalism. it is funding the business model that can support these very expensive enterprises. we have to have accurate information in a democracy. accura information gathered by independent source is as critical to a democracy as the right to vote. and, i can't myself imagine today when we don't have newspapers in this country, but   it is not the newspaper supplied. it is, will there be some independent source of news that people can read and compare to the government's version of the fence and then make their decision as a citizen on what they want their government to do. that is the problem. >> hi mr. schieffer. i am mitch from crofton high school. i am that history and government teacher there and it is apparent to me as a history teacher thatthe media has a big influence in shaping the legacy of a president. my question to you in light of the recent election of our first african-american president is, do you see the legacy of lyndon baines johnson and his involvement in the civil-rights movement. of course you have first-hand experience with that, reexamined currently? >> i think in the end history will look more favorably on lyndon johnson then perhaps it does even now, because this was   a remarkable achievement-- a lot of people, my brother, who used to be an ambassador and he used to have history courses for the young foreign service officers in his embassy. he had a class of 20 of them. now, these are grown people, foreign service officers and in that group only three understood it was lyndon johnson who passed the 1964 and 1965 civil-rightsact. they all thought john kennedy had done that and of course kennedy had said that a motion but that was something johnson did. i think in fact johnson will be looked on more favorably. i would just say this about what you say the media has a tremendous impact on a presidents legacy. to some extent, but not entirely. and i would say that in this way. good public relations, a good press, never trounce a bad   policy. and bad policy never tromps a good press. as an example of that i would cite the nixon administration. richard nixon did some awful things then history will remember him for those things but he also did some good things. the opening to china, the arms control agreements made with the soviet union. these were magnificent achievements. we remember them as just that, even though he got really bad press for what he did withwatergate. so, in the and good policy-- could presidents are remembered for their good deeds. some tate man's it takes time for that to unfold but in the and it happens. >> and if you could just bend a brief moment, because legacy, is interesting that is a function of history which does take time and sometimes we like to rush to judgment on things. even with lbj in historical times, wasn't that long ago. >> well, i think that is exactly   right and i have a personal rule and i got to this rules your personal experiences. that is, i think you ought to wait at least five years before you try to make even a preliminary judgment on the presidency and i say that, and i'm kind of learning it the hard way. in 1989 i wrote my first book. it came out, ronald reagan had just left office than it was a book called the acting president. everything in that book isaccurate, and it is still accurate and i am proud of it but it is not exactly true. i say that-- this is what i mean. when ronald reagan left office we didn't know if the soviet union was going to collapse. i am not saying ronald reagan gets sole incomplete credit for the collapse of the soviet union but the fact of the matter is some of the policies he put in place did contribute to the   yunus-- united states basically winning the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union. you could not know that in 19881-ish tup the book, so if i had written the book five years later i would have taken a slightly different tack on that. i think that is true and all presidencies. you know, if iraq winds up being a stable, successful democracy in the middle of the melodies,where only israel is now a democracy, we may come to have a kinder view of george bush then we have right now, but we don't know the answer to that question right now. >> during the program we are going to pull students from the close-up academy and the washington center, get their reaction to some of the issues being raised on the program. our first poll program is this. is the influence of the news media at on our society good or bad? this is one of those questions.   how many of you feel the media influence generally speaking good on society? let's see bishop hands? how many feel right now we are going for a period where the media influence on society is negative? that is a smaller number. let's find out from the mic which of you feel it is the negative influence? if you could introduce yourself and articulate your position. >> i am from washington stateuniversity. i feel that the media is typically a negative influence because it really creates a fear, like society, that it really appeals to is a very short attention span, and the stories that are reported and things like that are very, very quick, there is something that people can watch and forget or if it is fearful, and stays in their minds. i feel that it has created-- our   society today, a lot of people are very edgy. people think there's a lot more crime then there was in the past but that is not necessarily the case. ifill overall it is a very negative impact. >> i am tawny from arizona state university. i would say that overall the media has a very positive impacting keeping our society informed. that is pretty much the linchpin of democracy, citizens knowing the issues.there is merit to the argument about political bias in reporting and possibly dumbing down shortening attention spans with a short 32nd blurb of media stories but if you look at societies where there isn't a large media presence or a government controlled media presence, the societies are not free necessarily. their citizens are not informed. the government as a free hand to do whatever it wants, and i don't think that is a good situation for anyone to be in.   >> i was just out to washington state and it is a wonderful school but i have got to say, i have got to go with arizona state on this one. [laughter] but me just ask you this. close your eyes. as bad as the media is, imagine this country with no news except what you got from the government. what kind of a society do you think we would have? >> not one that i would want to live in, so i also agree. i see both arguments veryclearly. i think the impact is negative and positive so it is kind of like two sides. >> if you remember nothing except this from this, you can agree or not but just remember it. the difference between a totalitarian society, as you pointed out, and a democracy is in a totalitarian society there is only one source of the news and that is the government. in a democracy, citizens have a   choice, because they also get a second source of information and that is the information that is provided by a free press. they can take with the press gives them on this hand and what the government gives them on this hand and decide which version they want to believe. i think that there is no other reason for a free, independent press, that is the reason. you have that second source of information about the government and what it is doing and what itis doing with your money and with your life. that is a reason that it democracies simply cannot exist without a free and open press. >> bob, something we talk about often and i think our society is still grappling with a bit, with their 24-hour news cycle there was a time not that long ago when walter cronkite would say, and that's the way it is. that is what we talked about. that group collective understanding of the state of the world until the next news   cycle and now is being continuously refreshed. >> you know, there is a mission statement here at the newseum that i think is one of the most important statements anyone has written about america or democracy. it said that a free press must have, and i don't know the wording exactly, but a free press must provide the means for people to be outrageous, but italso has the responsibility to provide fairness, something of that nature. if you go in this newseum-- newseum there is a section of the berlin wall, which tells you all you need to know about societies and how they ought to be run. this section is about as wide as the studio and you walk in there and you walk in on one side, the western side in here on this wall is graffiti.   some of it is obscene, some of it is funny, some of that is silly, but it is just covered with all of this graffiti. that was the western side of the wall. you walk on the other side of the wall, it is absolutely clean. there is not a speck, nobody has been allowed to write anything, nobody said anything and that tells you all you need to know. on one side of that wall, people were free to speak out and say what they thought about thingseven if it was outrageous, even if it was wrong. they have the right to go up there and do it. you go on the other side of that wall and there is nothing there. it is a sign of a sterile society where everything including a person's right to speak his control. >> hello, welcome to close-up of the newseum. >> hi, i am from miami florida and i was wondering what you thought about the coverage that president bush received a route his reign?   [laughter] >> i thought it very. i think it's pretty much reflected what we saw. when president bush was governor of texas, and i am from texas, he was very well liked. he worked well with the democrats and republicans. he had kind of a bipartisan kind of approach to things. he ran his campaign for president in much the same wayuntil we got to new hampshire, where he was surprised by the being soundly defeated by john mccain. they thought the bush people thought they were going to win new hampshire and win big. just the opposite happened. and, they made a decision that the way they have operated as governor, the way they had campaigned as governor and the way they campaigned up until that point was apparently not going to work and they decided   instead of going for votes in the center, going for the moderates, they would turn to the right and try to energize the base of the party. they did that, and it really change the character of the campaign. they went on to win. i have always argued that they would have won anyway, that john mccain did not have the money to sustain his campaign. he had to win every single primary, they didn't.that was the decision. the campaign turned bright, they won narrowly, narrowly. they continue to govern from the right. i think the fact that he won by such a small margin had a great impact on his presidency and the success or lack of that we saw after that. i think had there been a solid win, if he had won by a certain   margin, that he would have been much more successful because what happened, a lot of people did not consider his presidency legitimate, and i think that was a problem. i think that was a problem for george bush and i think the coverage reflected the problem, not the other way around. >> bob, give us a moment because a lot of people lose sight of the fact, the transition the press test to go through covering won administration tothe next. when we went from the clinton white house to the bush white house pre-9/11, the press remarked that if they press conference says it is going to start it to a clock and it starts to a club and does not run all afternoon. there was a different style. of course 9/11 events overtakes style. the obama administration comes in and events, there are so many of them that it is the offence driving the coverage. what is it like being in a press corps that has to make those   kinds of transitions? >> every administration brings its own trademarks and its own ways of dealing, especially with the press and a lot of that, pretty much what you get in the campaign is what you can expect during the, at least the first month of any administration. barack obama brand one of the smartest campaigns that anybody has run in my, in my time herein washington and i have been here 40 years. this was a model campaign and i'm not just talking about the general election campaign but i am talking about the campaign they brand during the primaries, when he defeated hillary clinton. he had the right strategy and she didn't their idea was, we will win the big states, we will wrap it up early on super tuesday, we will create this era of inevitability and then we go from there. he went for the small states.   he ran a nationwide campaign and in the and his strategy for a failed. you can't agree or disagree with their ideology, they are very good politicians and i think you are saying that. but now of course the river has set the road. we have these enormous problems and whether they are going to be able to solve that, this financial crisis we have gone through, the sums of money that they have had to devote to","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 5, 2009 7:00pm-7:30pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

[inaudible conversations] >> please take your seats, we are going to get this session started because we don't want to waste time. good morning. try that again, good morning. >> good morning. >> my name is roger, on the other co-director of the campaign for america's futureand i want to welcome you to this annual conference. since 2003 we have called it take back america and this year the name has been changed to america's future now and the reason for that change is you. finally in last year's historic election and, we to gather did take back america just-in-time. we took it back from the edge of   disaster. so the people in this room deserve a lot of credit. i would like you all to give yourselves and president barack obama a big round of applause [applause] for progress is taking back america from the radical right wingers were taking the country in the wrong direction, that was just a first up. during our years in the wilderness, a progressive scanning our eyes on the prize.rebuilding our country. we worked creatively to build strong new coalitions to advance bold economic agendas for prosperity and opportunity and democracy. and in the process, in the process we build a strong progressive movement. in 2006 and again in 2007   candidate barack obama came here and spoke at take back america and after putting his own stamp on what we were talking about here, candidate obama took our progressive change agenda into the election contest in with your help he won a powerful mandate to take our country in a new direction. i want to note that candidate obama and his team also learnedfrom organizing techniques as well as our message, the campaigns used the community organizer instincts, barack obama with the inclusive technology and activist energy pioneered by groups like moveon.org, howard dean, and the progress of loggers. so we have quite an interchange you an early on and now with the president in the white house and   a democratic majority in congress, our job is two go beyond taking back america, our job is to win real change. and that as my partner, boris, said today will require a sophisticated inside outside strategy. like martin luther king and lyndon johnson in the '60s and the labor movement and franklin roosevelt in the 1930's and1940's. president obama who started as a community organizer in chicago clearly understands this. that every president, every successful president needs the outside citizen movements in order to make big changes. let's just listen the two what he told us that take back america on his most recent visit >> and all of you, activists from all across the country, we   will take our country back. take back to america, this is our time, our time to make our mark on history, our time to write new chapters in american story because there are a few obstacles that withstand the millions of voices, not from the top down but the bottom of. that is how we brought an end to discourage of slavery and brought an end to jim crow, that is how women got the right tovote, how we brought an end to the viet nam war, how we will bring an end to the iraq war and exactly how you and i will change this country. [applause] >> he gets it, he understands and during a speech to amazingly successful first 100 days he stayed true to that vision and working together led by people   like heather both who is. the audience progress of coalitions held to win big victories passing the economic recovery package in the budget and building crucial momentum in a forward direction. now, you will see in the plenary sessions at this conference focus on the big battles that come, the economy and, health care, education, workers' rights, immigration and real security. right now we want to hear fromorganizers who have built winning organizations and around a progressive ideas. each of them represents the kind of constituencies that will have to work together if we are going to turn this year radical majority of congress into enacting a majority for change. so here's the question i want them all to address -- how did we get here and systematic moment in history and how we move forward together? our first speaker is an insider   who or illnesses like an outsider. i will say mitch stewart is the responsible for barack obama being in the white house but he and steve hildebrand played an enormous role in a crucial victory in the iowa caucuses and you know how crucial the those iowa caucuses or and then he went on to pull off another miracle turning the commonwealth of virginia blue for barack obama.[applause] he is now director of the new organizing for america, the 13 million strong grass-roots an online course that emerge from the campaign to help obama win victories. mitch will talk about how they won the election, the mission of organizing for america and how they plan to work with outside groups. please welcome mitch stewart. [applause] >> thank you all very much and   thank you for the gracious introduction and for putting this conference together and for all the folks here participating. as roger said i did start on the campaign the third week in january of 2008, i lived in iowa for a. then travel to a number of different states, nevada, minnesota, texas, indiana and then spend about six months in virginia which was a truly gratifying experience. there are a number of thingsthat we learned during the campaign that i think because of the president's unit background as a community organizer helped instill in us a new way to reach out and talk to people of bella lipitor campaigning -- electoral campaign and that is that people matter and all too often in campaigns people are paid less service but they are not taken seriously so we have a model on the campaign, respect and   already includes and we took every person's point of view very seriously, their efforts, their sacrifice, and we fell into that empowerment there would be more invested in our success and if we didn't take the time to build that sort of repoire. we basically took that from iowa and did that in every primary state, every general election state moving foreign and is something we're going to do and have done with organizing for america. for folks who may not befamiliar, organizing for america is a continuation of the same grassroots organization that cosby is reelected as opposed to elect oral organizing we are now focused on supporting the president's agenda shortly after the campaign ended we send out a detailed online service in both to our e-mail list and ask them what they wanted us to do next. now that we have one, went to like us to do? and the number one response to that question was to help support the president's agenda.   the second response was two continue growing in building this grass-roots organization, our folks wanted to see this continue so that is basically organizing for america's mission. to support the president's agenda, nothing will ever supercede that. we're here to support the president's agenda. the second mission statement is two continue building this grass-roots organization in the way we will continue building that is by supporting the president's agenda and i will give you a couple examples of what we have done and where wesee ourselves six months down the round the first issue that we took on was an economic recovery package and there was a lot of disinformation initially about what was then that. we felt it was important that we collected stories from average americans about the economic crisis was doing that to their friends and neighbors and what was it doing to their communities so reorganized 3600   house meetings. we talk about all those in the package and ask people to collect stories here and we received over 30,000 very tough stories to read through about the economic crisis was doing to them. and we then put that up on our website is out another e-mail and send these are the stories of the economic crisis and this is fine passing the economic recovery package is so abhorrent. we then moved on to the budget and support of the president's budget priorities where we collected thousands of pledgesand also have our supporters want in hundreds of thousands of phone calls and two congress urging support of the budget priorities. we then moved on both to judge sotomayor nomination and encourage people go to barack obama it, and you can take action in jenna sotomayor nomination and then, of course, health care.   on june 6th we will have house meetings where calling health care organizing take off across the country. thousands how large a sign up and tens of thousands have agreed to attend. the goal for the stick, is to fall to start the process of reaching out to neighbors and friends using the side same tactics during the campaign having friends talk to friends about why it is so important for the president's health care principles and there are threeprinciples that i am sure many of you are aware of -- the first is lauren the cost for american families and american businesses and the second is maintaining choice so that folks have both choice of their doctor and their plan and then the third it is assuring access to affordable health care for all americans. the fourth issue can put in their and john that talk about this is we have to get a pass this. getting it done this year.   so we're going to have our friends go out and talk to their friends about why it's so poor that we get health care passed this year, getting people to sign a declaration in support of the president's principles and the second component is also public service and we are going to be doing public service of funds across the country this summer. and we want those public service events to be health care related. i think organizing for america has a couple unique roles in what has been a very long battleto get health care reform. the first is we have the ability i think to tell very personal stories about what health care reform is so urgent we need it. we put out an ad to our last and received hundreds of thousands of personal health care stories about what reform is so necessary. the second is i do think that we have this now work of people because of the lessons we learned on this campaign who are ready and know how to go out and start engaging people in their   communities. the important part is not just one on the clock in this is something we learned during the campaign and by that i mean and they are going to have to walk door-to-door and are having to make 100 on calls that the real benefit of educating and getting people invested in this effort is when they're off the clock and hanging out with their bodies and at the grocery store and at church, just having conversations 20 and day and someone brings this up, the have a wealth of information and basically turning into themessage machine. and they are able to engage their friends about what health care reform is so urgently needed and because of that we know that the best of alligator, the best messenger of a message is someone who knows and trusts. not a tv ad or radio spot or direct mail piece, hearing from some of the vanowen trust and have a longstanding relationship with and will continue to have that with traumatic invalidate the president's health care   principles. and we hope to do that in mass across the country until it is passed frankly. just really quick on an organizational of dead and then i will sit down and get ready to answer questions -- right now we have people in 30 states and we will have a staff or an office in every state in the country. narrow who will be using opportunities like organizing around health care to continue building these neighborhoodteams that we had during the campaign so that we can further support the president's agenda and on the agenda of they certainly we will be focused on health care and i think you'll see us continue to get engaged with judge sotomayor nomination. moving for a and then also energy cajun. the president laid out three pillars of to get our economy moving again, energy, health care and education and you'll see organizing for america very   active on all three of those fronts so i thank you for giving me an opportunity to come here. i look for to chatting with you both after a session here but also during the q and a so thank you also watch. [applause] >> thank you, mitch. bob anna burger started as a local activist in pennsylvania and now is the most powerful woman in the labor movement.one of those powerful people in the labor movement and as secretary-treasurer of seiu and share a change to win she leaves the political operation and to place a leadership role in building the new infrastructure for the progressive movement. in the various coalitions and organizations mad seiu unchanged to win are a part of and the broader effort that goes to reflect in this conference. just recently she helped oust   and less as bankamerica's chairman. [applause] and that effort is part of a growing campaign for regulation of the financial industry and at the same time she serves on president obama's economic recovery advisory board. anova knows a lot about inside and outside strategy is to win a real change and how have to change to win so please welcome anna burger. [applause]>> conwell >> thank you and it is great to be here. this is an incredible panel it is a long time coming. we have worked hard, tramp about being able to salvage as about how to have american futures now not some way, ""healthwatch"" that actually changing america's future now so i'm excited to have this discussion with all of you. it was a year ago that we came   to this conference to take back america and we did it. the stakes are high back then a one at the last conference and i was even before the economic collapse, that was all about green corruption in the bush administration that cared about the top 1 percent in not anybody else and so i want to officially welcome to washington. i want to welcome you to washington d.c. to the nation's capital where people have read them their
         
          country and have secured our leader in the whitehouse. it is a new day in america and we have begun the work of transforming our countries, our communities and families. we do have a remarkable president, one who thinks big axe boldly and it's great to be here with all of you who have helped elect him and make this happen here and because all of us together have worked hard for years to have a transformational action, to work for electing progressive majority said that actually make change happen. and we have all learned how to work together to come out of our   silos and understand are a lot for a work in much more effectively if we were together in partnership and that is what got us here. i'm incredibly proud about the work the labor movement has done. seiu change the other labor unions and a generation after generation have a workers given the opportunity to use their voice, their passions and skills to build new objectives. from the founding days of ourunion we haven't been on the side of workers marshall as by politicians and left behind by society. we're native born emigrants men and women and people of all colors, ordinary people he wanted the and respect and voice on the job and in society. and through the union we have been able to use that boy is to organize a and a gain in change laws for all working to families. and during the last election we are proud of the work that we did because we're out there   side-by-side with bellavia. we were in the workplace and on the doors and in the phone talking about the economy and the american committee is about what matters to working families. we reach new voters and sometimes voters, we were about a brass states and states we never thought were and what we did all mattered to believe that we actually one north carolina, florida, indiana and all the other states that we knew we had to win was amazing. [applause] and we did because we donepeeper, worked stronger and were more determined than ever been before. our members held when governors races, expand the majority in the house and all muskett to 60 votes in the senate and when al franken is seated i guess we have to have the official 60 members. [applause] and all worked incredibly hard because we were incredibly passionate about barak obama, a liking him to be our president and that election, the work that we did actually was a transformational a luncheon.   it was transformational. when how we talk about issues, race in the economy and what happened, about how some policies and government. the importance of getting rid of trickle-down and understand government was good for all of us. taught us about what grassroots could do and when grass roots will matters and across our country people came together because they want to build a movement for change not just take a little steps for change. that is what this election i think is about, what the labormovement in, certainly with the campaign in which was to build a grass-roots movement that was not just about winning the election but making change happen and that is what i think we did and now what we need to do. which is actually not just having the opportunity to make change happen and make happen. in our country needs a more than we ever needed it before because president obama inherited a mess, let's be honest here. 8.9 percent unemployment, higher   for african-american and latinos and going up, 5.8 million underemployed, one ad of every six workers of america either unemployed or underemployed and over 58 percent think they will lose their jobs next year. 46 million without health care, 14,000 lose yesterday analysts said today and tomorrow. over 50% believe they will lose their health care this year. with with one and 11 houses inforeclosure and half are because health care cost. so we know that this is a credible time and we have to be able to meet bigger and faster and i'm proud of what the president has done because an economic recovery and put people to work, far reaching a budget that as meaning a difference and i was so proud of the first time i was in the white house when he spoke to the whole press corps and send some people thank you need to be part of the problem and i thank you need to be part of the solution.   [applause] that the truth is workers are fearful and hopeful, they want a transformational change here and 80% one big change in health care and 80% one in government that is going to be on their side of not treating good jobs not offshoring them and 80% on an active government that is on their side and that is what is at risk because while we are fighting for change the other side has not let go. we might have won this election but the chamber of commerce andthe forces against change or rent their and the jews as we have to be there as big as they are because they will not let this go evenly. this is a fight for power. as the head of home depot said when talking about the employee free choice act and it was the end of civilization as you know at. [laughter] was be serious as they wanted to be, the top 1 percent is everything and we get nothing. [applause] what was and so we're beginning to emerge when the corporates   have a first the last and only saying and not time for people have a sanguine. trying to make sure that the republicans just say no, and the democrats in incremental and small son that we have to be out there in force as well. as why our unions seiu one change that works, 400 organizers in 35 states making sure there is a drumbeat for change here and we need to do that because otherwise","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 5, 2009 4:00pm-4:30pm EDT",,,,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2009,

turndown in needs of the most vulnerable magnified by disasters at the same time the donations to travel organizations are decreasing. like many nonprofit organizations that depend on the generosity of donors, we are faced with financial challenges. the major disasters of 2008 such as wild fires in california, flooding and midwest and hurricanes gustav and ike based on donations. we are fortunate organization   receives support -- >> try to wrap up if you could, i'm sorry. >> with that i will conclude my presentation and if you have questions i would be happy to answer them. >> thank you. ms. durden? >> thank you, chairman landrieu. it's an honor and privilege to have the opportunity to speak today on behalf of the united way and the 211 system across america. as you are aware 211 is an information referral line that connects people to existingcommunity resources like rent and mortgage assistance as well as food and utility assistance. however, to 11 please a vital role in disaster response and recovery. trained specialists assist callers in times of natural disaster in crisis providing real-time information on shelter locations, food and water distribution sites and important evacuation routes. 211 disseminates accurate   information about the prices and relieves the very overworked negative 11 dispatchers also taking those non-emergency calls. as you are aware, to 11 was a bright spot and a very difficult time in our state and responding to the 2005 hurricanes katrina and rita. prior to the land all of katrina, the 211 and new orleans had to close. united way, united we of northeast louisiana and monroebegan taking all of the 211 calls directed from new orleans. overnight we expanded from a four person call center and mom wrote to a 65% to 11. we have additional support that was outstanding. from 211 call specialists of america 25 states send people to the community and there were hundreds of local volunteers that responded. as the result of that in lonrho, to 11 responded to more than   111,000 calls in two months. the call volume peaked at 7,358 the day that rita hit. after 2005 we were even better prepared for 2008. going into the hurricane season in 2008 we had a partially integrated telephony, statewide disaster plan, centralized the sastre database and 24 hour day 70 a week coverage.211 louisiana answered more than 170,000 calls between gustav hitting august 31st and a december 16th 2008. in the peak of that we were assisted by the 211 system of california which was invaluable expanding capacity and a today window when ike hit texas and the timber texas 211 answered   157,000 calls an absolutely incredible response. inland, the aftermath of hurricane ike caused flooding and wind damage throughout the midwest. the 211 in missouri and iowa, indiana and ohio place significant roles in the recovery effort. lagat one tero nine preparation is well under way and i'm pleased to report we have complete integrated telephony for about the state oflouisiana. most importantly we have an extended enhanced relationship with louisianan state government. i am pleased to tell you we have had both red cross, 211 and national guard embedded in the dss for months of planning that have been under way. and there i would tell you statewide we have recruited and begun training response volunteers if called upon. however they're remain enormous vulnerability and i would like to address those. the current economic crisis has   searched the call volume beyond current capacity of the system in many locations across america. most 211 are still in need of critical elements for disaster response for example, generators, remote control calling ability, telephone service priority of arrangements with telephone companies and significant concern to all of us are the gaps and services along with the u.s. atlantic coast. to properly respond to disaster211 across america need to unify technology and standard operating procedure to ensure best responsiveness. every president must have to 11 access on any kind of telecommunications device particularly self loans. 21 wants need a system of national edna per kildee with each other and other three digit numbers. senator landrieu, we are in desperate need of congress held to insure both reliable response to disasters and everyday needs.   fortunately congress can cure the vulnerability during this session by passing the calling for to want one before the next event occurs. senator landrieu we are grateful for your steadfast support of the legislation, for your code sponsorship of the bill and ability to deliver on dedicated federal funding for louisianan 211 this year. thank you again for the opportunity and i welcome the opportunity to answer questions. >> thank you very much.i appreciate content of all of your testimony and thoughtfulness that went into it. i would like to start, mr. mascelli, with the questions about this chart, the national shelter system. i know that this was probably in your testimony in some detail but could you take a minute to explain? these are the only official who red cross shelters and would you describe most of them as school   buildings or most of them churches or places where people worship? how would you describe the shelter if someone looked at that map and said describe the actual buildings those dots represent. >> yes, senator, you are right in the sense most of them are public buildings. part of the criteria when we look at buildings with safety construction etc. is to have facilities to support apopulation, kitchen, bathroom, etc., schools and churches fill the bill quite readily so most of them are either churches or schools throughout the u.s.. we had the shelters before katrina, but after katrina we actually put those into a database so the first time in a computer database we could see where they were at short notice, what might be available and also when we have a disaster of local   chapters will report back on the shelters and the number of people in the shelters etc.. >> and the school issue is interesting to me because you obviously in a catastrophic disaster that we had and others have had. when people move into schools for a long period of time it's hard to back to the operate the school. and one of the essentials iningredients of recovery for parents with children used to get their children back in school as soon as possible because at least then when the children are in school that parents can go about all the work they need to do to rebuild their home, business, etc.. how does the red cross negative the use of school buildings in areas that could potentially suffer catastrophic flooding and destruction and do you have a backup plan in the event using   schools in some areas might not be the best in that circumstance? >> there is right now work being done but there is a long way from a solution regarding and on that you are right a catastrophic disaster, what happens when you have large numbers of people better dislocated all i7 basis for long periods of time there is the housing task force that fema hasthat should be the natural connection getting people from shelters into some other type of housing. i know that looking at evacuation's of people to other areas is a possibility, but that has its own trials and tribulations in terms of moving and dislocating people from other communities. so as it stands right now, the options are kind of limited and we feel quite a bid to   particularly when people evacuate from one community to go to another community and that community would like to get back to normal again, so it's something that until a solution comes up for interim housing for large numbers of people we will still be struggling with that. >> and in the red cross model right now on the sheltering program, do you have a frame work of one week or two weeks orthree days or 30 days? you were sheltering plan as i know for immediate, not long term so what is your definition today? >> we'll look at emergency shelter for about a 30 day period and think over that for a variety of other reasons that may not be good environment for a lot of folks so unless it is absolutely no other option available, we would like the sheltering to be within the 30 period.   >> and mr. foresman, given this is what i would identify as one of dozens of caps that i see across the board this is one of them. do you have any comment about any private-sector solution some of your members might be willing to step forward on this particular issue? >> senator, i do, i have got three points i would make. first, i think that part of what you heard an administratorfugate's testimony is defining the objective rather than the process, and i think that is critical and you sit in your opening statement that part of it is about how do we link because disaster housing is very much a community state issue, local issue. federal government is a supporter and a lot of different ways but it's about being able to partner those entities with those local governments not only in the context of crisis preparedness the first 72 hours but what are the innovative solutions to do large-scale   housing operations and i think that fema is to be commended for having gotten the report out on housing but we have got to address the issue what are beginning to do if god forbid we have 200,000 americans homeless again because the solutions we have on the table will not solve that force and house by colleague from the red cross has pointed out you can't leave them in schools indefinitely. the second point we have seen through a lot of corporate sponsors who engaged in areactive way as a big player in the community's initiative crestor has provided technology about be unable to identify resources on averitt deskill for instance in a local community and of being dependent on traditional government resources identification, but private sector tools that allow the private sector to put in their resources and make those available to local officials to the nonprofit community to a variety of others to deal with it. and the final comment is this,   senator, you know, we have been wrestling with a model of disaster preparedness for the past 25 years that apparently isn't good for catastrophic defense. when you heard in the last hour with administrator fugate's testimony and vision and from the colleagues of 211 and red cross and united way is 21st century thinking for disaster response and recovery. that is what the ready come yaki is about. let's not put it on the back of government to try to beeverything to everybody in the midst of a crisis. the crisis. >> thank you. i want you to know i agree 100% with what you said but i also would stress it is important for the federal government to be able to function efficiently and well because when it does and the other party is whether they are private-sector, non-profit or states where locals have that much more of a difficult time,   so you are correct. the focus of this is is the nation ready, not just is fema or homeland security ready or the federal government ready, is the nation already, but it is important for at least the federal infrastructure to be and i think the vision administrator fugate, and i happen to agree with you about the quality of people now in these positions and if any team could get it done this is the team that canwith our support and of course a lot of other people's and put. mr. mascelli, let me ask this about the red cross. i understand, i don't understand, i know congress just appropriated a significant amount of money for the red cross which maybe is not unprecedented but it's not usable. can you comment on the financial stability right now of your organization and what resources you have to address this pending   hurricane season? >> yes. in addition we did receive an appropriation from the federal government and we are in the process of drawing funds through the federal emergency management which is the executors of the grand -- >> and how much was that? >> $100 million total. and we are in the process join for that reimbursement of expenses over the last hurricane season and it continues untilthe end of this fiscal year, federal fiscal year. in addition to that we've taken a number of activities to basically come within budget and looking at our financing part of that is we have restructured the organization fairly substantially at the national headquarters and then with the chapter structure to reduce cost and we are in the middle of that at this point. in addition to that aggressive fund-raising campaign to get out in this type of -- in this time   of economic instability to be able to raise funds when we have these disasters on an ongoing basis so we believe the combination of cutting back and restructuring the organization reducing expenses, aggressive fund-raising and use of the appropriation that we should balance our organization. we do project the next fiscal year which begins the first of july we will have a balancedbudget and proceed on that basis. >> thank you. and what is your operating budget? >> i did have to get back to you. counting the biomedical services it is a little over $3 billion. >> miss durden, can you comment about the bill we are moving through congress and again, what the two or three most important parts of the legislation are for supporting national network   basically of volunteers in large measure it is led by staff, but leveraged by volunteers the would provide not only the operations but the training necessary to provide the backup communications so essentials in disaster of any size for small disaster and as mr. fugate said if it is your roof that is gone it is not a small problem for you.but tell us again about the specifics of what you see benefitting in that legislation. >> the column for the 211 act is critical, and i think the first point is only 80% of the country has access to 211. there are 23 states in america that have 100% coverage as we are in louisianan. 25 counting puerto rico, i think there's a map that shows that. >> the map could be put out so   the full coverage is -- >> the full coverage is in and green. >> and the red states are? >> weare 211 is in development and i think it is particularly concerned that there are gaps along the gulf coast all the way up to delaware, long island, new york, rural georgia, north carolina and panhandle of florida are some of the areas there are gaps and that is ofsignificance. another factor that this authorization bill would allow was the telephony capacity to be connected. we are blessed in louisianan that there was donors that gave after katrina that enables us to have a voice over ip and then gives the opportunity with flapping of a switch to move it around and that is an absolutely incredible opportunity. but that is rare in our country   and so the capacity for technology is critical. >> if you could take that down if you would just a moment and leave the state issue. >> the map. >> nicoe and the new york has gaps at the highly urbanized area blacks were shaking your head, new york, new jersey. is it pennsylvania? >> that is correct. >> and is that kentucky, westvirginia? >> kentucky, south dakota, wyoming, the western states but on the eastern seaboard and the reason i raise this issue at this hearing in the beginning of the season is the production site seen or the feeling about the season because the storms have been so intense in the gulf coast there is some sense that this is the east coast time and   i just need to reinforce i know people in the northeast haven't had a storm for a long time but there are some significant studies that show what will happen if there is, and it is not a pretty picture. and in 1938 there was a major storm that hit all my mind, and you can just understand and think about the population was and what it is today.80 deer sophos -- 80 years plus later. and in that highly urbanized area they're virtually is no communication of people outside of your 911 if you want to report an emergency. but in terms where you can get shelter and where you could get   a voucher for a house or a meal for your child, that is basically the surface that you provide. >> that is correct and you are right. it speaks to the urgency of this call in for 211 act in your supporting and i have to tell you that we know that was never more vividly described or illustrated than after mauney left in the state of new york didn't have it, the state of connecticut did and the documented difference andresponse in that earlham iced region of the country was did fit and to one point was a very successful and the response of the state of connecticut and it's well documented the concerns that occurred in new york following 9/11. >> in 1938 a category four hurricane struck long island and destroyed 75, said buildings and displaced thousands of residents. so the question is for these   highly densely populated areas if you don't have a number to dial to get information, if your electricity is severely compromised, if you don't have the right sheltering plans and if the only fema housing plan were still what it is today fema trailers, we are in for a very serious situation here, and that is why this committee continuesto work and we will continue to work but it is just a matter of time. and i don't know how much more i can do personally to impress upon people have insufficient some of these, i mean, how real some of these gaps are and what catastrophe lies ahead showed a hurricane five or four or powerful free slam into one of these urban densely populated   urban and low-lying areas along the coast. so having said that i don't know if we have got just a short amount of time if there is anything you want to add i have bought one or two more questions. is their anything, mr. mascelli you would like to add how you are going to shelter millions of people. >> in the level of capacity and preparedness in the area, itreally, these catastrophic disasters are an animal on to themselves and something that fortunately we have not experienced until recently and there is a great deal of work that needs to be done particularly in those in areas we seem to do okay that is those happen on a regular basis but when you get to these catastrophic events large populations affect large dislocation it affects the whole   country, economy, the people, the psyche, etc. so is something that keeps us concerned on a consistent basis. >> just for comparison, not to beat a dead horse, but it has been something that as a senator from louisiana and lead spokesperson for the gulf coast on this issue i have to say that with the terrorist attack in new york, which was a horrible totally different kind of event,but there were a confined number of buildings that were destroyed in a very confined space and while it was a disaster that rocked the world, 99.9.9% of the people were home in their own homes and there was a small percentage of people led by eight rudy giuliani and all the   rest of a very small groups that were focused on this particular thing. i mean, hands-on, the whole world watched, but that night in new york and new jersey and connecticut and almost everyone was in their own bed. that is the difference between what happened there and what happened in katrina where that might in the storm 2 millionpeople were somewhere other than their own bedroom. and i don't think the country understands what this coin to happen if this happens in new york or new jersey or connecticut or pennsylvania, virginia, anyplace. and i think people think that they are now going to be impacted by category five hurricane. i think they think they've built buildings strong enough to   withstand them but i beg to differ. so i will continue to, you know, make my valise heard to the president and the leadership and hope that we get through the storm season of without facing a category three, four, or five in a major metropolitan area. not that new orleans is not a major metropolitan area or galveston or houston, but northeast metropolitan area has a lot more density than even wedo along the gulf coast because the numbers are staggering and i don't know, ms. gif anitere if you want -- >> i want to thank you for your sense of urgency and give an update regarding this critical issue of the urban parts of the northeast. new works and has excellent coverage of 211 but because the economic condition of many states specifically new york state has had to cut their funding of 211.   so you are absolutely on the point as you talk about that urgency in those metropolitan areas. the other comment i would make an you know this differently while you did an outstanding chart that shows the 73% growth in call volume in a two-year period i think the public needs to understand those 14 million our people and during her katrina, those were people whose lives were being saved by the volunteers and staff on thephone of 211. we did rooftop rescues, we did connecting people to the appropriate governmental entities and the most vivid example happened to someone you know quite well, joe thomas's wife, robin, was serving as a volunteer and took a call from a man who went back into his home and found his mother's body. there was no one to call about 211. i think that you were urgency to continue this funding and legislation speaks to the need of american people and i want to   thank do for that. >> thank you. any closing comments? >> senator i just want to make also add thanks having spent a few years doing this i've gotten good at realizing there hasn't been a lot of efficacy on the hill, consistent advocacy on disaster response and recovery and to the .1 of the things we have seen with the ready come emt initiative is i know the you are focused on hurricanes your constituency, that's yourgeography, that's one of the biggest threats that you face but over the course the last 60 days have a little bit of a shake in the los angeles region and we've had a scare from pandemic and the one recognition and the one thing i strongly encourage you to do is let's make this about the need for better capabilities to deal with catastrophic events particularly housing in respect of the cause is because the senator from illinois appointed out he's more concerned about tornadoes or   whatever we are calling them or microbursts these days and we've got to make sure we are designating the argument with the people who are here. >> i will tell you what i am going to do because i want to support the white you just made on and going to call a hearing for earthquakes particularly and i want to show a film in this committee of what is going to happen when an earthquake, a major earthquake hits not just california but memphis which is a target and i am going to usethe risk assessment that has been done by the risk managers to show the likely disasters based on their scientific information this isn't what senator landrieu thinks might happen, this is what our government and scientists and leaders believed is probable to happen and what this committee is going to do is try to continuously show those probabilities and the gaps to   respond to what we are predicting is going to happen. and as we work i realize there are other priorities in the government. this is not the only priority of the government but having represented people who lived through and survived through a catastrophic disaster it is hard to tell them that there is of a priority -- another priority. for the","[curator: unknown title] : CSPAN2 : June 5,
